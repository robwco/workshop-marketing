First off, welcome! I just sent you an email. 

**Make sure to whitelist my email address to keep gmail from throwing my emails out.**

Each Friday I send a small group of freelancers some projects from that week. These projects come directly to me and are sometimes available nowhere else so they're a great batch of gigs.

To get this weekly email, there's 3 ways you can sign up:

1. **Refer a client**<br>If you know of a great client who's currently looking to hire, [send them this referral form](https://airtable.com/shrtjRuOvexpQgBrv). Then after they've submitted a project, email me and I'll add you to the list.
	
2. **Post your own project**<br>If you're currently looking to hire someone awesome, you can use [this form](https://airtable.com/shrtjRuOvexpQgBrv) yourself to hire from the community. We'll include it in the newsletter.

3. **Sign up for my lead-gen service**<br> Customers of my premium lead-gen service get the referral email as part of their subscription. [Go here for more details.](/leads)

That's it. Those are the only ways to join the referral newsletter.

It keeps the entire thing really personal and awesome.

If you don't have a project or client to refer right now, no worries! Now that you're a part of the Workshop community, you can join anytime. 

I'll also be sending you some other awesome stuff shortly.
