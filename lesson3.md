OK. So I just gave you <a href="/where-to-find-clients">the top 5 places</a> to go to get high-value UX/frontend design clients. 

These 5 sites make up 80% of the great projects posted online.

And the biggest source of all is <img src="/images/page-elements/angellist.jpg" class="h-6 align-middle">AngelList.

If you wanted to do the least amount of work for the most great clients, this is where you should start. 

You will get a handful of great leads coming to you each week for a few minutes of setup. Boom. Zen. Buddha would approve.

**AngelList**

On AngelList there's hundreds of projects from startups all over the world. It’s my go-to for startup clients because companies on AngelList are usually funded and comfortable working with remote freelancers and design firms.

Best of all, they have a great alert feature so that when a new project gets posted it will come directly to your email, no other setup required. Note: they don’t support RSS currently.

**Here's how you set AngelList's alerts**

First create an account. Next, [go to the jobs page](https://angel.co/jobs):

<img src="/images/page-elements/angellist-jobs-alert.png" class="shadow-lg w-full rounded-lg my-4">

Use the tags “Contract”, “Remote OK”, and “freelance” along with any other relevant specialization terms to find project-based work you can do from anywhere.

Then, once-a-day you'll magically receive an email with all the new projects that get posted on the site meeting your requirements.

That's right. In a few minutes you've gained access to tons of interesting projects you can peruse over your morning coffee - free! :ok_hand: Ommmm... 

When you see one you like, you can also find budget information under the word "compensation" to the right of the job description. 

If everything looks good the next step is to apply. AngelList has an application system which you can use by clicking the blue "Apply Now" button.

You'll want to make sure your AngelList profile looks good, which is outside of my specialty so [here's a techcrunch article on that](https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/02/winning-angellist/).

**Important: Don't stop there.**

By clicking on a company logo at the top of the job you can also find a company website, twitter account, company founders, and even github links. 

Use these to find a contact email and send a supplemental email to go with your AngelList application. 

This email can be as simple as saying what caught your eye about their project. 

Don't be scared, most startups will be happy to see you've gone the extra mile. I always recommend doubling up whenever a website has a private application system. 

This includes sites like:

- [Behance](http://behance.com)
- [Authentic Jobs](http://authenticjobs.com)
- [WorkInStartups](http://workinstartups.com)

Because all the bidding happens privately on sites like these, applying can be time consuming – but you can usually track down an email and double your chances just like that.

I know because every lead I send my lead-gen customers has an email attached to it. 

Now, AngelList emails you new projects daily... but what about every other site? 

You don't want to visit each one by hand each day, so next I'm going to show you how you can check all of them all in one place.
