<h1 class="leading-tight font-medium text-3xl mt-8 pt-8">My 5 favorite places to find UX design clients that are ready to buy</h1>

We just talked about how to take control of everyday conversations your UX design firm is having. Doing this takes a change in strategy. 

But doing what comes next takes a change in mindset. 

**Old mindset:** Scarcity

**New mindset:** Abundance

You may not have even realized you were living in scarcity mindset. But let me ask you this: have you ever told yourself dry spells *were just a part of business?*

Where the heck did that come from?

Unfortunately it probably came from other professionals. The fact is most consulting advice is stuck in scarcity mindset.

Every forum you go to (including my favorites like designer news and hacker news) you'll be told that dry spells are just a part of business. 

You'll be told that you can't go get great clients, they HAVE to come to you or else they'll be low-quality. 

You'll be told that emailing people is pointless and spammy and that ALL YOU CAN DO is update your portfolio endlessly. 

So all you can do is sit and wait.

Bullshit.

My day-job for the past 3½ years has been going out and finding great clients. I'm able do it consistently by simply looking for opportunities online.

This tiny daily action has resulted in over a million dollars in client work landed.

Had I listened to freelancers online who say it's impossible - this never would've happened. So use it as proof that you and I have the ability to control our income.

Now, sure you might not be able to find every client this way… but you don’t have to — most UX design firms just need to fill the gaps in their schedule. 

THAT you can do.

Best of all, it’s not really that hard.

I do it, and I’m just one guy. In fact, you can get 80% of the results yourself by just visiting a handful of websites every day.

**Here’s the 5 I recommend you start with:**

1. [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs)
2. [Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=seeking%20freelancer&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=pastMonth&type=story) 
3. [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com)
4. [Workable](https://www.google.com/search?num=50&safe=off&biw=1152&bih=596&tbs=qdr:m&q=site:*.workable.com+freelance&oq=site:*.workable.com+freelance&gs_l=serp.3...6986.8111.0.8192.10.10.0.0.0.0.128.703.8j1.9.0....0...1.1.64.serp..1.0.0.Kts5oUCQJSM)
5. [RFPdb](http://www.rfpdb.com)

That's it.

There are plenty of others but you can find enough great clients to fill the gaps in your schedule each year by using just these sites for free. 

I know. I do it every month. It’s worth it. It will bring you peace of mind knowing that you are always just a few conversations away from a new client.

Don’t believe the critics that say you have to live with feast or famine in your business. The truth is you can build a solid business if you build on a foundation of results.

If you’re curious about how to use these sites efficiently, don't worry. That's what we'll dive into next. 

Let's start with the top place for finding clients: AngelList.
