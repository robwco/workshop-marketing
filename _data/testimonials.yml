  quote: "“In less than a year I’ve won close to $65,000 in projects from Workshop alone. All of them have become repeat clients who I expect will be buying additional services over the next few years.<br>The best thing is it runs on email so it’s easy to process, archive, or save. If I get busy I can leave it alone until I have time for it."
