    <h1 id="why-do-dry-spells-happen">Why do dry spells happen?</h1>
<p>If you’re a freelancer or consultant you’ve probably noticed your business is plagued by a vicious feast or famine business cycle. This means that all of the time you have to look over your shoulder.</p>

<p>Every day you live in fear that an untimely bill will put your checking account over the edge and in the red.</p>

<p>You know that dry spells poke holes in your income, business trajectory, and sanity. Yet you probably don’t know the true cause of them.</p>

<h4 id="its-not-why-you-think-dry-spells-are-not-a-natural-part-of-freelancing">It’s not why you think. Dry spells are NOT a natural part of freelancing.</h4>

<p>Not entirely anyway.</p>

<p>While it’s true there are natural ebbs and flows to any sales cycle – long periods without work don’t occur just because.</p>

<p>They happen because of specific actions you take (or don’t).</p>

<p>Think back to the last time you were stressed out about not having any work. It probably kicked your butt into high gear. In fact, that’s probably the last time you dedicated whole days to looking for work.</p>

<p>It made you desperate and you probably hated that feeling… but guess what? It also probably worked. After all, you made it out.</p>

<p>Have you ever gone through a rough patch only to later have way more clients than you can handle come to you for work all at once?</p>

<p>It’s easy to throw your hands up and curse: <em>“Oh sure NOW everyone wants to hire me. Where were all of these clients 2 weeks ago?”</em></p>

<p>What you don’t realize, though, is you caused it. If you hadn’t waited until you had no work to start a mad dash of client outreach, you could have totally avoided this situation altogether.</p>

<h4 id="the-truth-is-dry-spells-actually-begin-when-youre-fully-booked">The truth is dry spells actually begin when you’re fully-booked!</h4>
<p>That’s why the trick is to not wait until you’re out of work to do something about them.</p>

<p>It sounds easy, so why don’t freelancers do it? Because when you have work you’re too busy to look for leads. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking: sure this all makes sense but if I’m too busy, then I’m too busy – and forcing myself to keep up with an endless treadmill of sales activity doesn’t sound like something I want any part of.</p>

<h4 id="thats-why-you-need-to-break-your-freelance-sales-cycle-into-a-set-of-small-actions-you-can-do-in-15-20-minutes-every-day">That’s why you need to break your freelance sales cycle into a set of small actions you can do in 15-20 minutes every day.</h4>

<p>See, just like client projects tend to go way over the timeline you have in your head at the beginning of a project, the income you get from them won’t sustain you as long as you think it will.</p>

<p>Before you know it you’ll be out of money, and still have to finish up the project.</p>

<p>That results in a huge loss all around.</p>

<p>Worse, relying on sheer willpower to create sales won’t work. That’s why your inbox is distraction central instead of a sales machine.</p>

<p>You need a system that you can follow effortlessly, no matter how busy you are.</p>

<h4 id="so-enough-with-feast-or-famine-heres-how-well-build-your-pipeline">So enough with feast or famine. Here’s how we’ll build your pipeline:</h4>

<p>This course will walk you through how to go from paycheck-to-paycheck freelancing to booked 6-months out.</p>

<p>Each chapter will break down a specific way you can find clients, pitch them effortlessly, and win work TODAY - so you never have to worry about where your next project will come from again.</p>

<p>The first step is to sign up and get 10+ high quality freelance leads looking to hire someone like you, right now.</p>

<p>It’s absolutely free, and I’ve hand-checked each lead for quality to make sure they’re all 1) looking for a freelancer, not an employee 2) open to working remotely with a freelancer anywhere 3) have a specific project they need help with 4) have a budget of at least $1000.</p>

<p>I’ve also included every lead’s contact info like email, twitter, website and photo so you can envision yourself working with them before you ever contact them.</p>

<p>The method behind the course is called the CALM freelancing method and it’s designed to make it easy to load up your work pipeline by breaking down daily sales into small actionable steps.</p>

<p>There’s four rules that make up the CALM method:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact a new lead everyday:</strong> Because you’re a freelancer you don’t need thousands of clients - you really only need a handful. Contacting at least 20 leads a month (or one per day), means you’ll have all you need in new opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Always put yourself in the client’s shoes:</strong> It’s hard to email someone when you don’t know who to contact or what to say. Instead of trying to come up with something from scratch, I’ll show you how to pull words from your prospects mouthes and write something compelling so they’ll respond every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Line up work 3–6 month’s into the future:</strong> Because most of us think dry spells start when we run out of work, we don’t prepare during times we actually have work. I’ll show you exactly what to do so your sales activity doesn’t just stop when you land a client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make it automatic:</strong> The CALM method can take up a lot of bandwidth if you don’t prepare by automating it wherever possible. You’re busy running a consultancy, and if you can’t imagine doing even more on top of all of this you’re not alone. I’ll show you how to create a sales system that runs on its own and allows you to sleep great at night instead of stressing over your business.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
