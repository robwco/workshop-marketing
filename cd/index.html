        <h1 id="you-know-you-can-help-thousands-of-businesses-so-why-does-freelancing-still-feel-like-a-race-to-the-bottom">You know you can help thousands of businesses… so why does freelancing still feel like a race to the bottom?</h1>

<p>It’s because you’re not in front of these companies on a daily basis - and finding them isn’t exactly easy or fun. After all, you’re already working too much. You have existing clients to take care of, important emails to write, and fires to put out.</p>

<p>Doing lead generation on top of all of this sucks. Checking job boards every day (or worse: elance) just isn’t the best use of your time… and you know it, which is why you put it off. After all, you want to do the work you love, not search for it. So instead you wait for work to come to you (read: do nothing).</p>

<p>But putting off these tasks only makes things worse. Much worse. It makes you have no control over the work you take on… so instead of firing bad clients, you’re forced to put up with them forever.</p>

<p>As a result, you don’t get paid what you’re worth, you get low-balled. You don’t know where your next project is going to come from and you’re constantly worried about dry spells.</p>

<p>It’s not worth it.</p>

<div class="feature kurt">
<p>“My clients were always my priority but when I had too much client work, I neglected sales activities and my pipeline suffered. Since starting with Workshop, I've had an unbroken chain of daily lead generation activity no matter what. I use my inbox as a to-do list and every day that workshop email is a convenient reminder to get selling.”</p>

<h1 id="dont-believe-internet-trolls-freelancing-doesnt-have-to-be-feast-or-famine-you-dont-have-to-rely-solely-on-referrals">Don’t believe internet trolls, freelancing doesn’t have to be feast or famine. You DON’T have to rely solely on referrals.</h1>

<p>It’s time to do something about the holes in your sales funnel. Your business needs access to all of the best opportunities out there. Likewise great clients and companies looking for a shop like you deserve access to your services and expertise – regardless of whether you remembered to check some job board.</p>

<p>But how? You know you can’t be everywhere at once. You can’t even imagine finding all of these opportunities yourself, how are you going to also make time to contact them? You can’t. You just need them delivered to you. That way, you can focus on selling your company, the thing you KNOW how to do – the thing you want to focus on.</p>

<h1 id="what-if-refreshing-your-inbox-every-35-seconds-wishing-a-new-client-would-appear-was-a-thing-of-the-past">What if refreshing your inbox every 3.5 seconds, wishing a new client would appear was a thing of the past?</h1>

<p>If you woke up every day with a dozen great clients looking for your help, what would it mean to your business? Would your revenue double? Would it turn your on-the-side freelancing into a six-figure consultancy?</p>

<p>What if sitting and waiting wasn’t your only strategy for finding work?</p>

<p>If, overnight, you stopped wasting time looking and just got the best opportunities automatically instead? Or if you could simply reply to people and projects you were excited to work for, straight from your inbox? And what if it took minutes (instead of hours) to fill your sales pipeline each morning and then you got to focus exclusively on billable work the rest of the day?</p>

<p>What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client’s project and blow them away? Would you use the free time to go on a walk and clear your head? Or would you just spend more time with people you care about?</p>

<h1 id="let-me-send-you-the-8-12-best-leads-on-the-web-daily-so-you-can-wake-up-focused-on-winning-work">Let me send you the 8-12 best leads on the web daily so you can wake up focused on winning work.</h1>

<p>You might think this life is impossible. However, for hundreds of consultancies in Workshop it’s a reality. I’ve created a hands-free lead generation service for consultancies looking to make more money building websites (and apps, and logos, and more). From the day you sign up, you receive the highest quality leads on the web. Every opportunity from every nook and cranny on the web, pre-qualified and sorted into your inbox.</p>

<p>It’s also super affordable. Even if you’re just freelancing on the side, you can easily take advantage of my offer. It’s the cost of a cup of coffee a day. But you won’t love the service because it’s cheap, you’ll love it because it works. Because it’s the best thing you can do for your business.</p>

<div class="spacer" style="height: 10em; display: table;"></div>

<h4 id="so-what-happens-if-i-dont-like-it">“So what happens if I don’t like it?”</h4>
<p>No worries. There’s a 30-day 100% satisfaction guarantee. Enjoy Workshop for a full month and if you don’t like it for any reason, send me an email and I’ll give you a refund. I don’t want your money if you’re not 100% blown away.</p>

<h4 id="my-schedule-is-fully-booked-should-i-still-sign-up">“My schedule is fully booked. Should I still sign up?”</h4>
<p>Yes, here’s why: it’s a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen because we fail to line up work during <strong>flush times</strong>, times when we’re loaded with work NOT when we’re actively looking for work like during a dry spell. Just because you have work now doesn’t give you the right to put your hands up and stop all sales activity.</p>

<p>On the contrary. Now is when you should start a small daily amount of activity to ensure you never run out of work again. If you’re not booked at least 6 months in advanced, it’s a sign you’re susceptible to a dry spell.</p>

<h4 id="how-many-leads-will-be-sent-and-how-often">“How many leads will be sent, and how often?”</h4>
<p>I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes more, sometimes less but the whole point of Workshop is that you save time. That’s why I always send fewer, better leads. I never send a lead just to hit a quota. In fact, Workshop’s value is equally about the leads I don’t send as it is about the ones I do because the thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely mean you can focus, making the handful I do send more important.</p>

<h4 id="i-just-started-freelancing-what-if-im-not-ready">“I just started freelancing. What if I’m not ready?”</h4>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much experience you have, the habits you build into your business now will stay with you for a long time (maybe forever). That’s why it’s important that you push yourself outside of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>Leveling up your consulting business isn’t about planning for the future. It’s about taking small steps right now that will ensure you’re in the best position to succeed. I guarantee that if you can build a website, design, or code - at any level - you can also make a lot of money from Workshop today.</p>

<p>But it takes investing in yourself now.</p>

<h4 id="but-will-workshop-work-for-me-i-specialize-in-x">“But will Workshop work for me? I specialize in X.”</h4>
<p>Right now Workshop is mostly focused on web design and development. However, we have a steady amount of other work coming in like mobile, marketing, graphic design, and more. I group leads in categories so you’ll be able to quickly see if there’s enough value for you.</p>

<p>If you’re still worried there may not be enough of your type of lead, the best advice I can give is to try it. There’s a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee for this exact reason. Sign up for yourself and see.</p>

<h4 id="im-outside-of-the-us-is-that-a-problem">“I’m outside of the US, is that a problem?”</h4>
<p>Not at all. Workshop has top freelancers from all over the world, including places like Europe, Asia, and basically every other continent in the world who are loving the service. All leads are 100% remote and open to remote freelancers anywhere in the world, so I’d suggest you sign up and see if it’ll work for you.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-have-you-been-doing-this-does-it-work">“How long have you been doing this, does it work?”</h4>

<p>I started doing this with select consultancies in November, 2013. Since then I’ve helped hundreds land work. Some have even made hundreds of thousands of dollars from my leads. Now, I focus on Workshop full-time, which wouldn’t be possible if it didn’t produce massive results for my customers.</p>

  <h4 id="ive-gotten-over-my-imposter-syndrome">“I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome”</h4>

  <p>I like to focus on projects that are particularly interesting to me, and fit my skill set well. Amongst the work I scored from Workshop last year were two projects that have now blossomed into amazing client relationships and tens of thousands of dollars… with no end in sight. I was really on the fence about Workshop (and freelancing in general), but I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome at this point and realize I can compete and score some of these great leads.</p>

  <p>The day I took Workshop for a test drive, here’s how it went down:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>8:30 am- signed up for Workshop</li>
    <li>9:21 am- sent first email to lead</li>
    <li>10:22 am- had phone interview with lead</li>
    <li>10:40 am- received W-9 and project contract</li>
    <li>If this sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. And it actually happened.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because of Workshop I’m starting to build an on-going relationship with a client, which is beyond worth the cost. I typically don’t do reviews, rate things, etc, but this has to be said: Workshop is an incredibly EFFECTIVE tool, and a must-have for freelancers. Thanks so much!”</p>

  <p>I  ordered Workshop because it sounded like a dream way to receive possible leads. I hesitated for a while but ordered after a week. Robert wrote in one of his first emails, that it takes time and practice to actually land a project, and that it can take weeks or even months.</p>

  <p>I had no problem with that. Nevertheless, I landed my first project after just 4 or 5 days. The monthly cost of Workshop is covered already, and I still have weeks left from my first month. I’ll keep being a Workshopper, thanks Robert!</p>

  <h4 id="its-possible-to-actually-wind-up-with-more-work-than-i-can-handle-through-workshop">“It’s possible to actually wind up with more work than I can handle through Workshop!”</h4>
  <p>In seven months, I’ve closed 3 deals that total a little over $20,000-directly from the leads in Workshop. All three of these projects have led to long-term clients that continue to come back to me, so the value of these contracts continues to grow.</p>

  <p>One of the clients wanted a front-end developer, and now I am helping him build a travel booking engine. It has been a small but on-going project worth about $2,000 every month. Another client runs a successful e-Learning web application. I wrapped up the work that was in the scope of the project a few weeks ago, and just the other day, the client contacted me to see if I was available to take on some more work.</p>

  <p><strong>The discussions on the Workshop Forum (The Shed) has proven incredibly valuable, and have done a lot to improve my response-rate when emailing leads, my technique for following up, as well as my business in general.</strong> Truth be told, I probably could have gotten even more work through Workshop, but when I am very busy, I am selective about which leads I contact. It’s possible to actually wind up with more work than I can handle through Workshop! :-)</p>

  <p>BTW, I just closed another lead from Workshop, a deal to subcontract for a design agency. Its really great what you’re doing!”</p>

  <p>I signed up about 2 months ago when I decided to move away from my full time job and transition into freelancing. I put together a simple portfolio and replied to 2-3 ads per day consistently. After a month of the free trial I had made over $3000 off of Workshop leads and also got offered a full-time contract ($100,000/year roughly).</p>

  <p>That’s a bigger return than I ever expected. It’s brought a ridiculous return and if I ever move to freelancing again, first thing I’ll do is sign up for Workshop again.</p>

  <p>But the price actually ended up forcing me to improve because I started thinking of myself as a company rather than just a freelancer. It pushed me to think about having an actual sales funnel, and all the assets that go along with it.</p>

  <p>I’ve also really enjoyed the tips and help Workshop provides to help me close leads. I’ve created my sales funnel and will combine it with the hugely valuable slack community!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) What was the obstacle that would have prevented you from buying Workshop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first I was worried about the lead quality and quantity. If the leads weren’t a good match for my services or there wasn’t enough of them then the service wouldn’t have worked for me.</p>

<p>2) What did you find as a result of buying Workshop?</p>

<p>Once I figured out my process it made it easy to complement my own lead generation process. Every day there was a good chance that at least one lead in Workshop could use my services.</p>

<p>3) What specific feature do you like most about Workshop?</p>

<p>That it’s email so it’s easy to process, archive, or save. If I get busy I can leave it alone until I have time for it.</p>

<p>4) What would be three other benefits about Workshop?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leads grouped by type let me ignore the ones that don’t apply to me.</li>
  <li>The additional contact information makes it easier to find the actual people behind the project.</li>
  <li>The educational content around writing better emails and other topics help me improve my own process.</li>
</ul>

<p>5) Would you recommend Workshop? If so, why?</p>

<p>Yes. It’s a great service to supplement other forms of marketing while requiring very little time.</p>

<p>It’s especially valuable if someone is checking job boards by hand because there are a lot of full-time and non-remote leads that you’d have to filter out.</p>

<p>6) Is there anything you’d like to add?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In less than a year I’ve won close to $65,000 in projects from Workshop alone. All of them have become repeat clients who I expect would be buying additional services over the next few years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) What was the obstacle that would have prevented you from buying Workshop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the ROI would be worth the monthly cost.</p>

<p>2) What did you find as a result of buying Workshop?</p>

<p>The “potential” ROI is enormous and worth the cost.</p>

<p>3) What specific feature do you like most about Workshop?</p>

<p>I like that while I get leads covering various types of work, they are grouped by those types of work making it easier to find the leads for the type of work I focus on.</p>

<p>4) What would be three other benefits about Workshop?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice to email people and get out of my head and realize that I am just sending an email and the worse thing that can happen is that it will go unread.</li>
  <li>Opened my eyes to the amount of work that is actually available, and not just what was represented by recruiters</li>
  <li>Realization that networking events aren’t referrals aren’t the only ways to get leads and work</li>
</ul>

<p>5) Would you recommend Workshop? If so, why?</p>

<p>I would and I did just the other night at a local development user group. It is vital to teaching people that they can find work for themselves, especially those who have relied on others, like friends and recruiters, for so many years.</p>

<p>6) Is there anything you’d like to add?</p>

<p>I mentioned before, but I still think the service would be better if the leads I received were customized to my category. I envision this as an email or website that I select the type of work I do, RoR, Full Stack, Mobile, PHP, etc., and then you create emails with 8 to 10 qualified leads for each of those and send them out to the people who have subscribed to or requested that type of work.</p>

<p>While I was mistaken when I first signed up, that is the vision that I had and ultimately the reason I ended up signing up. Now I just want to continue to receive the leads for the practice until something comes up and to help support the service. 
&gt; 
&gt; Mark Brown
&gt; Orange Park, Florida, USA</p>

<p>1) What was the obstacle that would have prevented you from buying Workshop?</p>

<p>Not being sure if the leads would be high quality, or right for what we do.</p>

<p>2) What did you find as a result of buying Workshop?</p>

<p>There’s almost always at least one apporpriate lead per email, and muuuuch higher quality than, say, elance.</p>

<p>3) What specific feature do you like most about Workshop?</p>

<p>Additional info, like twitter accounts and emails, to help get in touch with prospects.</p>

<p>4) What would be three other benefits about Workshop?</p>

<p>I like the tutorials on effective emails.</p>

<p>5) Would you recommend Workshop? If so, why?</p>

<p>Sure! It’s a convenient way to do regular outreach, which is crucial.</p>

<p>6) Is there anything you’d like to add?</p>

<p>Great job with WS!</p>

<h3 id="heres-a-closer-look-at-whats-included-and-why-workshop-is-perfect-to-help-you-land-your-next-client">Here’s a closer look at what’s included and why Workshop is perfect to help you land your next client:</h3>

<h4 id="you-get-the-8-12-best-freelance-leads-on-the-web-sent-to-you-daily">1) You get the 8-12+ best freelance leads on the web sent to you daily:</h4>
<p>Never worry about dry spells again and get a daily stream of hand-picked remote freelance projects, all with budgets over $1000.</p>

<p>Contacting just one or two of these opportunities each day makes this the only source of work you’ll ever need. It makes it easy to fill up your calendar with work months in advanced and effortless to stay on top of the latest opportunities.</p>

<p>In fact you’ll find it so easy to contact new work opportunities that you will be able to do it even when you’re fully booked. All it takes is opening up your email and replying to someone. Having new clients coming to you every day means you can build your business on your terms.</p>

<h4 id="done-for-you-client-qualifying-and-sorting-for-every-lead">2) Done-for-you client qualifying and sorting for every lead:</h4>
<p>Finding leads isn’t the only thing included in the daily email. I also hand-curate the list to make sure you can instantly envision yourself working with each client before you contact them.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to quickly see a photo of your potential client, their name, email, twitter, website, and project description. I also sort every project so you can quickly look through available projects in your specialty to find projects that are perfect for you.</p>

<p>Decide who you want to work for by approaching better clients and sending better emails in less time.</p>

<h4 id="access-to-low-competition-big-budget-projects-found-only-on-workshop">3) Access to low competition, big-budget projects found only on Workshop:</h4>
<p>My emails also contain big budget projects projects you won’t find anywhere else. People come straight to Workshop to post big budget projects because they know that they’re going to get a response from a handful of great freelancers.</p>

<p>Because Workshop is private, you won’t be competing with the entire world - just a handful of peers. But Workshop doesn’t step in or take a cut, you own 100% of the relationship with your clients and 100% of the project fee.</p>

<p>There’s nothing between you and the clients I send you, you email them directly from your inbox and your conversation stays private. Like all my leads, there’s no middleman referral fees, no app, and no confusing system to work around.</p>

<h4 id="bonus-1-you-get-your-own-personal-email-specialist-worth-200month">+ BONUS 1) You get your own personal email specialist. (Worth $200/month):</h4>
<p>To make sure you never feel overwhelmed I’ll assign you your own personal email specialist to help you contact leads and get up to speed with Workshop.</p>

<p>This 1-on-1 concierge help will help you pick which leads to email and keep you accountable so you make emailing leads a habit that sticks.</p>

<p>That will ensure you win more clients and always have access to a real person who can help guide you in the right direction if you don’t hear back.</p>

<h4 id="bonus-2-front-of-the-line-freelancer-application-to-folyo-a-premium-job-board-worth-99">+ BONUS 2) Front-of-the-line Freelancer Application to Folyo, a premium job board. (Worth $99):</h4>
<p>Great job boards are really hard to find and Folyo is the best freelance job board on the web. There’s a ton of freelancers hoping to get in to Folyo and it usually takes 6+ months to get your portfolio reviewed.</p>

<p>I’ve secured a special deal for you: a nearly instant application to Folyo.</p>

<p>With your premium Workshop subscription you’ll get your portfolio reviewed in less than 2 weeks so you have access to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of additional client project opportunities.</p>

<h4 id="bonus-3-instant-access-to-a-private-community-of-top-consultants-helping-each-other-on-slack-worth-99year">+ BONUS 3) Instant access to a private community of top consultants helping each other on Slack. (Worth $99/year):</h4>
<p>Consulting can sometimes feel like you’re running on a treadmill, alone. There’s never an end to the work and there’s almost nothing that can fix this… except for experience.</p>

<p>That’s why my favorite thing to come out of Workshop has been the community it created. It brings people that have been in your shoes to you. You can take almost any question to them and get a great answer. There’s hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of advice in it and almost every Workshop member has a part in creating it.</p>

<p>You’ll find some of freelancing’s biggest questions answered by all different types of freelancers.</p>

<h3 id="the-two-biggest-reasons-why-you-should-join-right-away">The two biggest reasons why you should join right away</h3>

<p>1) The membership fee is at it’s absolute lowest. Since starting Workshop in late 2013, I’ve noticed a bunch of copycat services pop up. These look-a-like services use automated scraping tools to find leads.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in that. Only a real, experienced, freelancer knows what a great client looks like. Not some scraping algorithm. That’s why while the other services continue to come and go, Workshop’s price will continue to increase. Today it provides more than 4x the value than when we started.</p>

<p>And when you sign up now and you’ll be locked in at the lowest price Workshop will ever be sold at, for as long as you’re a member.</p>

<p>2) Right now is when you should do something. Waiting to sign up is almost guaranteed to hurt your business forever. See, It’s a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen because we sit and wait.</p>

<p>Failing to line up work during <strong>flush times</strong> (not dry spells), is the real reason you run into feast or famine cycles. Just because you have work now, you’re short on time, or you have some other excuse, you shouldn’t put your hands up and stop sales activity.</p>

<p>On the contrary, now is when you should find next month or next year’s client. I don’t want you to wait until it’s too late, and in order to prove it I’m willing to take away all of the risk. You can get 100% of your money back if you don’t like it, at any time.</p>

<p>See like you, I know there are a ton of businesses who will benefit from working with me. Only you know the vision you had when you decided to strike out on your own and start your freelance consulting business. My goal is to help you reach that vision.</p>

<p>Warm Regards,
