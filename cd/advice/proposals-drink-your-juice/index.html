    <p>Drink Your Juice</p>

<p>Hi Lauren,
My name is Tyler van der Hoeven and I represent a small two man design and development agency called Tiny Anvil. [https://tinyanvil.com/]</p>

<p>I saw your post in Workshop this morning and we look like a perfect match!</p>

<p>Tiny Anvil specializes in design and frontend but if you’re willing to take a look at Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/) and its MongoDB we could also handle the development as well.</p>

<p>Either way I’d love to have a chance to talk and hear more about your project and how Tiny Anvil could come alongside to bring this app to market.</p>

<p>As a side note, if there aren’t a lot of features beyond what you described in the posting, I’d also say we could get it done for less than your allotted budget. One of the huge benefits of having everything being done under one roof.</p>

<p>Here are a few links to live sites Tiny Anvil has designed and developed recently.</p>

<p>Proposal for : Drink Your Juice
Overview
It’s our understanding that the primary goal of Drink Your Juice is to connect people who are looking to better themselves, to the experts capable of helping.</p>

<p>Proposal
We believe that based on the goal of DYJ, the focus of the app should be on providing the best possible infrascture to empower users to connect to one another, and start either helping or being helped. We beleive that DYJ should be viewed almost as infrastructural. It’s like a road system, where all of the destinations are places that will make the “driver” feel and become better than they were when they started.</p>

<p>We also beleive that DYJ needs to be designed with the intent for it to grow organicaly. Most everything needs to be designed to work well with little content at the beginning, but it needs to be capable of scaling up to larger and larger amounts.</p>

<p>The way I see this working out:
Have a user clarify what they’re looking to do, either better themselves, or help others. After a user clarifies, they should be shown a different set of screens depending on their initial selection.</p>

<p>Service Purchaser
Once we already know a user is looking for something, we can then guide them through the process of clarifying exactly what they’re looking for.</p>

<p>The user would then be shown a list of fields in which the current service provider group of users is offering. As well as a form labeled something along the lines of “What are you looking for?”.</p>

<p>Once we know what a user is looking for we can provide them with the ability to further describe what that is with a form tailored very specifically that thing.</p>

<p>After filling this out, a user can then do one of two things, either select a provider in their area, or list/post what they’re looking for and allow Providers to “apply” for it.</p>

<p>This will do two things: 
It will provide users who are doing the purchasing to feel empowered, and as if they are the ones with the product available. You can see people asking for help in long form variety fairly frequently on sites like Reddit, and actually getting help as a result. Also, it should provide providers with a much richer experience, and the capacity to find “work” immediately after setting up their account and profile.</p>

<p>Service Provider
Once we know a user is looking to provide something, we can then guide them through the process of clarifying exactly what what a user should be able to come to them for, as well as the ability to fill out a more verbose profile that includes contact information, descriptions of services, pricing, and credentials.</p>

<p>Design
While we do like the mockups you sent to us, we would obviously have to redo some things to account for the shift from Mobile only, to responsive web app, as well as the slightly shifted process we’ve detailed above. Along with the functionality being shifted, we’d like to do something similar with the aesthetics, with the primary goal being to make this entire app feel friendlier, and look even better doing it.</p>

<p>Summary
We’d really like to solve the problem of connecting people looking to help, with people looking for help, and we’d like to do it in a way that’s going to empower your user base to more or less build the site out for you. To refer back to our previous analogy, we’ll provide the roadway and the users will do the driving and build the businesses.</p>

<p>Budget Estimate
Our budget is broken down into phases, each to be completed in sequential order. This allows the project to broken down fairly easily into separate components if necessary.</p>

<p>Based on how we’ve come to understand DYJ, and how we’d ideally like to build it, our budget and timeline would be broken down as follows.</p>

<p>Design : 2 Weeks - $4,000 
Our Design process is extremely thorough, and will provide both you the client, our designers, and our developers with everything they need in order to completely understand how everything should work together, and what it’s going to look like.
Documentation 
When we design products, we start the process with a lot of sketching, and writing. Trying to really nail down the soul of the project, before we dig into mockups or code.
Wireframes 
Once we have the app planned out in text, we plan it out in pixels. Creating more or less a blueprint of the what, where, and how everything is going to work, without worrying about exactly how it will look.
Mockups 
Taking what we’ve learned in the previous stages, and creating mockups that represent the final look, and functionality that’ll be reflected by real world code when everything is said and done.
Front End Development : 2 Week - $3,000 
Static web based mockups built to allow for testing and demonstration. We’d also be building it using static Meteor code to make it much easier to plug in to the back end.
Back End Development : 4 - 6 Weeks - $6,000 
The final stage in the process that connects everything all together and makes it not only look and feel great, but actually work. This is going to be the largest single phase, but also potentially the most important. Once this phase is done, you’ll have a finished website and be ready to roll with version 1.</p>
