    <p>How do you improve your freelance onboarding process? I use Bidsketch to show proposals, contracts, and get feedback, approval, and signature. A hundred proposals later and never once has someone been confused by it.</p>

<p>I have also found that recording a quick screen capture video does wonders for helping clients work through a myriad of project related issues: explaining a wireframe/ui, showing them how to use Basecamp, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Examine a new client’s typical journey.
This means inspecting each step a client had to go through to a) find you, b) contact you, c) like you, and d) hire you. What are those steps for you?
Do they find you on dribbble, then email you? Do they use a form on your website? Do you email them first? What happens next?
Write down every interaction that happens in the typical order they happen. Examine this process all the way until you actually begin work on a project (bonus points if you go beyond). You’ll typically find there’s 10–15 steps for onboarding a client.
Once you’re done, here’s what your process may look like:
    <ol>
      <li>Client sees you on dribbble. </li>
      <li>They go to your website.</li>
      <li>They visit your ‘contact’ page and copy your email address.</li>
      <li>They go to their email hit ‘compose’ and paste your email address into the recipient field.</li>
      <li>They send you some brief details about the project, and ask you if you’re interested.</li>
      <li>You reply with a few questions about the project.They reply with answers to your questions.</li>
      <li>If it seems like a fit, you suggest a meeting over skype.</li>
      <li>They’ll accept your skype invitation, and ask you to pick a time.</li>
      <li>You give a day and time that works.If that day doesn’t work for the client, you send over a new one.</li>
      <li>Once you go over the project on skype, you outline a proposal or scope for the project and define deliverables.</li>
      <li>The client will go over what you put together and make changes.</li>
      <li>Barring any hidden surprises, you agree to a scope of work / proposal.</li>
      <li>You receive payment for the agreed amount.</li>
      <li>You have a kick-off meeting about the project and the scope of work expands a bit (which you don’t charge extra for, sadly).</li>
      <li>As You begin work on the project, you may have a few last minute questions before you can start.</li>
      <li>The client might have some questions about working with you, that he/she was too afraid to ask during the courting process. What’s your name again? Your start work on deliverables.
Now this isn’t the exact process for everyone, but I’m guessing a lot of these steps are familiar to you. Kinda messy, no?
In fact a lot of the steps could be eliminated completely, and still result in an improved client experience.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Answer questions before they’re asked.
Make it easy to get started: instead of waiting until the client contacts you to send over questions you need answered, add a form to your website with these questions built-in. Direct any inquiries that don’t come in via your website to that form, so that all clients know there’s an established process to follow when working with you. That’s what a lot of the examples above are doing, each in their own way; answering common questions potential clients have before they even ask them.</li>
  <li>Send a welcome packet that answers common questions and sets the expectation of what it’s like working together:
There’s bound to be questions a client doesn’t realize they have until you begin working together. Some of these may seem too awkward to ask (“what’s your name again?”).
Send over a welcome package with answers to frequently asked questions. Include a bit about yourself, what you specialize in, what you don’t do, how often you report to clients, what software/tools you’ll use, how/when you receive payments, how you present work, how you expect feedback to be delivered, your availability, and other questions people may have. It will start your relationship off on the right foot, and it’s also really impressive to send this over.
Send over this package as part of the sales process. Preferably before you setup a skype call, that way the client gets an inside look at working with you and can decide whether you are going to be the right person for the job before you actually spend any time trying to land the project.</li>
  <li>Qualify prospects before investing your time in the project:
Now that you have the answers coming in from your custom-built form, and have sent over a welcome package, you have a highly-qualified client. Now the fun starts.
Once you land the client it’s awesome to send the prospective/new client a thoughtful gift. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just something simple that shows you are thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile. It’s surprising how a $10.00 book can turn a casual acquaintance into a true champion. Bonus points if you’ve written the book you’re sending over.
A big benefit to productizing your consulting service is predictable revenue. It allows you to move away from selling units of your time. It also serves as a good introductory project for new clients because it’s easy to swallow and takes all risk away from them. If you do it right it’s all about your client. They get to relax by and shop for a finished, definable, outcome in comfort.
By no longer trying to get crazy amounts of traffic, you’re making people who are really interested in your service offering come to you.
So when they do, make sure your website is focused on them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Over the years, I’ve picked up a lot of little things over the years to differentiate myself from other freelancers/agencies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>After a kick off meeting for a $10K+, I send a gift to the client by mail. Currently it’s a 1lb bag of Ethercycle branded coffee called “Coding Fuel.” I include a thank you note.</li>
  <li>I always send calendar invites for all meetings and phone calls. It makes sure they don’t forget our meeting and it looks professional.</li>
  <li>I follow-up on everything. This seems obvious but so many people can’t be bothered. I use Boomerang for Gmail to keep me on top of unreplied email threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a client, something small like the coffee creates an experience of thoughtfulness more than anything. That’s a great message to send.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t do anything that bad-ass but at the end of each week I make it mandatory that they send me feedback - and I try to make that experience as thoughtful as possible: https://robertwilliams.typeform.com/to/P8E4Yw</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I send over a design I’m presenting for the first time. I’ll send it over in video format. That way I really get a chance to explain the thought-process and explain my reasoning in a bit more of a loose setting, as opposed to a client reading a 20 paragraph email about the design and maybe missing my point completely. I also do this because design concepts are hard to grasp by reading about them, it’s easier to explain with a visual reference.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I try to send a personal gift around christmas to clients I have worked with throughout the year.</p>

<p>Two years ago I sent the DVD <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07t9NOV7SwY">“Happy”</a> and with a personal note asking them to reflect what has made them happy for the past year. I told them that one of the things that makes me happy is the ability to run my own business, set my hours and spend time with my family. They have been a vital part in making that possible and I’m grateful for it.</p>

<p>This Xmas I sent a copy of Jason Fried’s book ‘Remote’ thanking them for the past year and mentioning that even though I already know they have understood the possibilities of remote working, it’s a great read (and the books make them feel smart for adapting to remote working).</p>

<p>The book and the DVD has both been around $10 each. To re-invest $15 in a client that throughout the year have invested thousands of dollars in me seems like a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Also - at the end of my invoices I end with “THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS, WE LOOK FORWARD TO COOPERATING AGAIN SOON!” Not sure if it does anything but I’ve heard from several clients that they think my invoices look really nice and clean. If you can make someone appreciate your invoice, I’d say that’s a win :)</p>
