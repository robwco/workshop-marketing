<p>I’ve been helping freelancers find work for the past 9 months and in that time I’ve realized something.</p>

<p><strong>We do portfolios wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Most potential clients just want to see if you can handle their upcoming project. They don’t trust you yet, so your portfolio (along with the rest of your website) is one way to prove you know what you’re doing.</p>

<p>That’s why most portfolios are focused on past work.</p>

<p>“You want to see my experience, well here, look what I made!”</p>

<h2>The problem with most portfolios</h2>

<h3>Constant redesigns</h3>

<p>This approach meant that you, like most freelancers, have to agonize over your portfolio for weeks. In fact, you’re probably always eager to add projects to it.</p>

<p>This can quickly turn into complete redesigns every time you have something to add. Which can quickly turn into burning-out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You envision your portfolio landing you great clients but the actual results tell a different story.</p>

<h3>Counter-productive goals and strategy</h3>

<p>Alone, your website doesn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People outside of your industry have a hard time finding out what it is you even do. Do I code? Design? Write copy?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apparently, big screenshots of your work with no explanation suck at explaining your role on a project.</p>

<p>Your dribbble and github profiles are prominently displayed across all pages, because hey that’s what people do right?</p>

<p>These links not only send potential clients away from your page, they also send them to websites where they can browse through thousands of other amazing designers and developers. Probably not your best idea.</p>

<p>To illustrate it another way: does Amazon link you to Best Buy and Walmart? No fucking way.</p>

<p>Because you have no strategy behind your portfolio, other than “highlighting your skills,” you spent 99% of my time tinkering with the work. The way in which you present and sell <em>your service</em> is a complete after thought.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder that after pouring weeks of hard work into your portfolio, you’re rarely satisfied and the website underperforms.</p>

<h3>Missing key information</h3>

<p>For a client, price is one of the key things they are looking for when they come to your website. More times than not, a client has a budget before they contact you. Ignoring this serves no purpose.</p>

<p>There’s actually many more factors involved when determining a budget. The dollars allocated for a task are just one part of it.</p>

<p>For example, a friend recently pulled the plug on a web design project he commissioned because it went over budget. The funny part is the price never changed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the project began, the timeline estimate was a few weeks. This project completed in a few weeks was a worthy investment.</p>

<p>Almost four months later, the project was still unfinished and no longer a worthy investment. Yet, the price hadn’t changed. It was simply an increase in time.</p>

<p>Addressing a potential client’s budget (and your value) is something you should do. Directly.</p>

<h2>Lack of empathy for client</h2>

<p>Not showing a price is only serving your needs, not those of a client. Ignoring the needs of a client is something that you should never do. These mistakes happen by not putting yourself in the client’s shoes.</p>

<p>We’ve all had bad clients – but take a moment to consider their side of the deal. It might surprise you that it’s not as awesome as you think:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the start, they’re forced to buy this vague thing you call a “service.”</p>

<p>Your proposal slaps a mysterious price tag on them of somewhere between a first-class plane ticket and a small home, with seemingly no reason for arriving at this number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your website or portfolio hasn’t hinted at this number in anyway and yet it arrives unannounced at time of checkout.</p>

<p>Imagine if you couldn’t see the price of Amazon items until you were checking out?</p>

<p>Imagine if items on Amazon came with a 6–24 month delivery, and absolutely zero guarantee that it would work in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That would suck.</p>

<h2>A new approach to portfolios</h2>

<p>A lot of successful freelancers and consultancies have switched to something else. If you’re not paying attention to this change, you may soon be left behind.</p>

<p>Instead of just showing off past work, these consultants have focused on turning their service offering into a story and using past work only to support that story.</p>

<p>This new type of portfolio improves the clarity of what is being offered and why it’s valuable. Instead of a portfolio, their website’s look more like a store or product page. There’s a clear buy button (or next step) and prominent pricing.</p>

<p>Their portfolio becomes a product that’s for sale for people who want something similar.</p>

<p>They use customized forms, mailing-list auto responders, and systematized documents that cut down hand-holding and instead on deliver more value.</p>

<p>They seem to realize that their website will never get a ton of traffic, so they focus instead on catering to the small group of people that actually visit their website. They spend weeks studying their customer and writing copy that will paint a picture of what working together will look like.</p>

<p>They’ve put themselves in their clients shoes and don’t shy away from pricing. They simply charge what they are worth and what they’re comfortable with.</p>

<h2>What these all have in common</h2>

<p>They focus on the client’s needs. They don’t focus on themselves. Not one even displays a typical freelancer portfolio. </p>

<p>Instead, they all focus on removing potential barriers clients may have.</p>

<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean creating a long sales page like the one above. Instead focus on a implementing the following:</p>

<h3>1. Examine a new client’s typical journey.</h3>

<p>How does someone go from stranger to paying client? What did they go through to a) find you, b) contact you, c) like you, and d) hire you?</p>

<p>Do they find you on dribbble, then email you? Do they use a form on your website? Do you email them first? What happens next?</p>

<p>Write down every interaction that happens in the typical order they happen. Examine this process all the way until you actually begin work on a project (bonus points if you go beyond). You’ll typically find there’s 10–15 steps for onboarding a client.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, here’s what your process may look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client sees you on dribbble.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They go to your website.</li>
<li>They visit your ‘contact’ page and copy your email address.</li>
<li>They go to their email hit ‘compose’ and paste your email address into the recipient field.</li>
<li>They send you some brief details about the project, and ask you if you’re interested.</li>
<li>You reply with a few questions about the project.They reply with answers to your questions.</li>
<li>If it seems like a fit, you suggest a meeting over skype.</li>
<li>They’ll accept your skype invitation, and ask you to pick a time.</li>
<li>You give a day and time that works.If that day doesn’t work for the client, you send over a new one.</li>
<li>Once you go over the project on skype, you outline a proposal or scope for the project and define deliverables.</li>
<li>The client will go over what you put together and make changes.</li>
<li>Barring any hidden surprises, you agree to a scope of work / proposal.</li>
<li>You receive payment for the agreed amount.</li>
<li>You have a kick-off meeting about the project and the scope of work expands a bit (which you don’t charge extra for, sadly).</li>
<li>As You begin work on the project, you may have a few last minute questions before you can start.</li>
<li>The client might have some questions about working with you, that he/she was too afraid to ask during the courting process. What’s your name again?</li>
<li>Your start work on deliverables.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now this isn’t the exact process for everyone, but I’m guessing a lot of these steps are familiar to you. Kinda messy, no?</p>

<p>In fact a lot of the steps could be eliminated completely and actually result in an improved client experience.</p>

<h3>2. Answer questions before they’re asked.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Make it easy to get started: instead of waiting until the client contacts you to send over questions you need answered, add a form to your website with these questions built-in. </p>

<p>Direct any inquiries that don’t come in via your website to that form, so that all clients know there’s an established process to follow when working with you. That’s what a lot of the examples above are doing, each in their own way; answering common questions potential clients have before they even ask them.</p>

<h3>3. Send a welcome packet that answers common questions and sets the expectation of what it’s like working together.</h3>

<p>There’s bound to be questions a client doesn’t realize they have until you begin working together. Some of these may seem too awkward to ask (“what’s your name again?”).</p>

<p>Send over a welcome package with answers to frequently asked questions. Include a bit about yourself, what you specialize in, what you don’t do, how often you report to clients, what software/tools you’ll use, how/when you receive payments, how you present work, how you expect feedback to be delivered, your availability, and other questions people may have. It will start your relationship off on the right foot, and it’s also really impressive to send this over.</p>

<p>Send over this package as part of the sales process. Preferably before you setup a skype call, that way the client gets an inside look at working with you and can decide whether you are going to be the right person for the job before you actually spend any time trying to land the project.</p>

<h3>4. Qualify prospects before investing your time in the project.</h3>

<p>Now that you have the answers coming in from your custom-built form, and have sent over a welcome package, you have a highly-qualified client. Now the fun starts.</p>

<p>Once you land the client it’s awesome to send the prospective/new client a thoughtful gift. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just something simple that shows you are thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile. It’s surprising how a $10.00 book can turn a casual acquaintance into a true champion. Bonus points if you’ve written the book you’re sending over.</p>

<p>A big benefit to productizing your consulting service is predictable revenue. It allows you to move away from selling units of your time. It also serves as a good introductory project for new clients because it’s easy to swallow and takes all risk away from them. If you do it right it’s all about your client. They get to relax by and shop for a finished, definable, outcome in comfort.</p>
