    <p>I do web development so it’s a bit different but here’s how I organize things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>dev/client-name/</li>
  <li>dev/client-name/notes.md - notes on the client, projects, etc. Mostly there so I can search for them later.</li>
  <li>dev/client-name/project/ - usually a git checkout of their code repository though some projects use multiple repositories so I might have another subdirectory</li>
  <li>doc/B/Business/Clients/client-name - contracts, proposals, and other documents.</li>
  <li>1/2 sheet graph paper in a notebook to take notes by hand or sketches (Levenger). I full page per client which gets stored in an archive notebook later (I will scan them someday too)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of my deliverables and assets are contained within the code repositories. For ones that don’t fit, I’d create a new directory off of dev/client-name/ (e.g. new design I’m integrating, database dumps).</p>

<p>Shared by Workshop member Eric Davis</p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s my current “system”:</p>

<p>I have a folder for code repositories, they are organized as such:</p>

<p>Repos/clients/{client_name}/{project_name}</p>

<p>For other documents, I simply have a client folder, and then a folder for each client. I also have a notebook stack in Evernote for each one.</p>

<hr />

<p>I wasn’t successful at marketing the business and had to shut down. Do you think you can please send me the code and files and turn off hosting as well??
Hey Ali,</p>

<p>I tuned off the hosting. I don’t have the code files.</p>

<p>Hey Robert, shouldn’t you have them in the folders you were hosting?
No, when I uploaded the files and we signed off on the project, that concluded the service I was providing.</p>

<p>Anyways with Magento (like with wordpress and other frameworks), you can’t really download “the folders” because it’s running a program that’s been installed on the server.</p>

<p>So there’s no way of receiving the intellectual property that I paid you to create for me? 
I gave you everything I had when the project ended, it was up and running and you signed off on the project when you received the intellectual property you paid me to create. That concluded the service I was providing you. Backing up files, saving them for you, or delivering them to you over a year after our project concluded was not part of our agreement.</p>
