    <p>Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I’ve sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p>Some examples of automation include: <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">Workshop’s long form sales page</a> which does a great job of anticipating and answering most questions. It also lets you sign up for a free course that drips more information into your inbox. Plus, I have a <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/advice">new FAQ</a> that answers Workshop + other related questions.</p>

<p>But still some people prefer to talk to a real person. They rather open up their email and fire over a quick question. I get that. Instead of trying to stop these tire-kickers, I decided to use a years worth of knowledge to answer their questions in a way that felt like I was writing to them but was 100% automated.</p>

<p>In practice this meant someone could send me their question, and get an automated answer back from me. Sort of like a create your own adventure book. I was able to do this with <a href="http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555">automation feature in Drip</a>, using ideas from Patrick McKenzie’s recent email: <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation">Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing this system has been one of the biggest wins for me (and my inbox) this year. Here’s what the process looks like:</p>

<p><strong>When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-welcome.png" alt="Workshop's Course Welcome Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve used this email before (without the links at the end) and it always got a high reply rate. But now even people who don’t have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. This is also where a years-worth of (at times brain-numbing) customer service paid off.  I came up with these 4 options because I knew it always came down to those 4. Note: I don’t keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback, it simply triggers a follow-up email.</p>

<p><strong>Clicking on one of the options triggers a one-off email that addresses their feedback:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: RE: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-followup.png" alt="Workshop's Course Follow-up Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve gotten a huge response rate to this email, because it feels so real – mostly because IT IS REAL. It’s exactly what I would say to one of those objections. It’s me.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’ve setup my site to be really focused on lead-gen and opt-ins from leads. I’ve even replaced my homepage with a (shortish) long form sales letter. My autoresponder course is pretty basic, it mostly covers what a potential client can expect working with me. Pretty much any freelancer or consultant could do the same. Topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What to expect</li>
  <li>The story of Little Stream Software</li>
  <li>The ideal client</li>
  <li>Project management and managing chaos</li>
  <li>What to expect before starting a project</li>
  <li>More than just code</li>
  <li>The end and a beginning…</li>
</ol>

<p>Then I’ll send out broadcasts when I have availability or a new guide (guides are one of my main incentives for opt-ins). It’s worked pretty good so far but I’m going to replace it all with more focused content. I recently re-focused my niche so this version is very generic.</p>

<p>Even starting with a short 3-day series could be valuable: “Hi I’m X”, “How I can help you”, “Can we talk?”</p>

<p>You know, a mailing list doesn’t have to feel like a mailing list. For example you might not need anything besides gmail and streak. Having a small group of people that you keep in contact with about common interests can be enough to create a small pool potential clients (and friends) that you interact with weekly, or monthly. Check out this email that my accountant friend sent me today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hi Rob,
Check this out. A startup is selling a $10 roll of quarters for $15. Sounds insane, but I can totally see a ton of people doing it. Sometimes it’s the simple problems lol
http://washboard.co
Have a great day!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no pitch, but it makes me keep him top of mind.</p>
