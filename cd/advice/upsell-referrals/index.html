    <p>I ask for referrals almost whenever I get a compliment.</p>

  <p>“Thanks, I’m happy to help. It’s amazing what [WHATEVER] can do.
I’m trying to help more people and wanted to hook you up at the same time.
Which one person do you know who would most benefit from my service?
I’d love to help your friends and family out as I continue to help you.”</p>

<p>A great marketing technique to use is to ask for 1 referral. Once you get that, then ask if they have another.</p>

<p>Another technique to use is basically, if they can refer you to so many customers, give them an incentive, like £150 per referral, or free hosting for a year, something that would show appreciation.</p>

<p>Yeah they’ve just hired you for your services, they’ve paid you, they’re now busy on pushing their business further, what would make them consider spending time getting you a referral if they don’t get anything out of it. Sure, some clients are great and friendly enough to do without blinking if the service you provided was great, but some not so much, they’ll be too busy, but my giving them an incentive you definitely in the right direction for another win.</p>

<p>Another way is to bake them into your on-boarding process - and making them a formal expectation of working with you - as opposed to something you mention in passing.</p>

<p>It makes the client prepare to actively look for someone who they could refer while you’re working on the project together instead of at the end of a project. One way to set this expectation would be at the beginning of the project (or in your contract) saying something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I do a fantastic job on the project and you’re 100% blown away by the outcome - you agree to refer me to at least 2 people that you know, who could benefit from a similar service.”</p>
