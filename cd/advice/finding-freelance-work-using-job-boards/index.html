  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In 2013 I started a service that finds hundreds of freelance leads for a small group of ambitious consultants specializing in design and development work.</p>

<p>This group uses my leads to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. Yet, 99% of them are available for free online. In fact, anyone could find them and land the same projects for free all by themselves.</p>

<p>Instead of hiding this, I’m going to walk you through exactly how I find leads every day.</p>

<div class="post-post-it-note"><strong>Note about Workshop:</strong> If you don't want to do this all yourself, you too can use my service to skip everything below and just have it done for you. You'll jump straight to the part where you have a limitless amount of amazing freelance projects in your email every day. Just sayin. <a href="/">Try Workshop today.</a></div>

<h3 id="heres-how-to-use-job-boards-to-find-an-endless-supply-of-leads-each-month">Here’s how to use job boards to find an endless supply of leads each month:</h3>

<h4 id="step-1-gather-your-supplies">Step 1: Gather your supplies.</h4>
<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Patience and perseverance.</li>
  <li>An RSS reader.</li>
  <li>A few hours a day.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-2-download-my-a-hrefhttpwwwletsworkshopcomdownloadsendlessclientscheatsheetopmlendless-lead-generatora-and-plug-it-into-your-favorite-rss-reader">Step 2: Download my <a href="http://www.letsworkshop.com/downloads/endless_clients_cheatsheet.opml">Endless Lead Generator</a> and plug it into your favorite RSS reader.</h4>
<p>This file comes pre-loaded with a huge chunk of job boards that I’ve collected over years of finding freelance leads. It’s an OPML file so all you need to do is import into an RSS reader and you can instantly monitor almost every job board that houses freelance leads.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-browse-the-rss-feeds-and-pick-the-low-hanging-fruit-first">Step 3: Browse the RSS feeds and pick the low-hanging fruit first.</h4>
<p>Look for projects that look like ideal fits first. I recommend starting with established job boards like Authentic Jobs and Behance. When it comes to this, getting started is half the battle. Don’t think you have to find hundreds of people to email every day. Instead, be consistent about finding 1 or 2 new opportunities daily. This should only take minutes to create a constant flow of warm prospects coming into your inbox.</p>

<p>Remember that ultimately it’s a numbers game, and burning out by contacting a billion leads on your first day won’t produce great results. Once you pick the 1 or 2 low-hanging, most desirable projects, contact them immediately. Later you can go back and find more if you have time.</p>

<p>If you open up feedly and see one or two project you’d like to work on, contact those before moving on. Here’s a video of me doing this process:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hHlh3yKUp0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Use additional search criteria when available, terms like ‘remote’ and ‘freelance’ will skip all the location-specific or full-time listings.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-find-niche-job-boards-that-apply-to-your-specialty">Step 4: Find niche job boards that apply to your specialty.</h4>
<p>Some job boards don’t offer an RSS feed. This means you have to go through their site by hand. While more time consuming, these sites are the home of some of the best freelance projects - especially if they relate to something you specialize in. To cut down on time, get familiar with where each job board keeps important details like location preference, budgets, and project type. Building up a familiarity with these niche job boards takes time, but there are so many new job boards popping up that there are constant opportunities to land work. Don’t look for ideal clients, instead look for people that need a problem solved.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s some examples of niche job boards:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=seeking%20freelancer&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">Hacker news seeking freelancer threads</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://larajobs.com">LaraJobs for PHP, Laravel jobs.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://djangojobbers.com/">Django jobbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.railsjobs.com/">Rails Jobs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve gotten the hang of this process and begin to land work consistently from job boards, you’ll find that it really doesn’t require you doing the work. In fact, since your hourly rate is pretty high it not make sense for you to do this entire thing yourself anymore.</p>

<p>Hell, even if you’ve never done it yourself and want to skip the learning curve of curating and hand-picking leads from job boards, and get straight to the awesome part high quality consistent freelance leads, you’ll want to outsource it.</p>

<p>You could hire a general purpose VA for $500/month+ or you could pay Workshop (my highly specialized service) to do it for you for a fraction of cost.</p>

<p>Save 4-5 hours a week and just get the best consulting opportunities on the web delivered to your inbox! Starting at only $99/month.</p>

<p>Regardless, using the steps outlined above you can generate steady client work just using job boards. This 1-on-1 outreach is powerful because you don’t have to rely on outside forces to win work.</p>
