I've been writing about being an independent business owner (and ex-freelancer) since 2013. Here's a look at all my writing. 

**Note: I'm currently going through and formatting, editing, deleting, and re-organizing, so it's a total mess. You've been warned.** 

For now, I recommend using Cmd + F to search for topics or keywords that are on your mind.

<ul class="archive">
{% for post in site.posts %}
<li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
