## How to write crisp, compelling emails that land you more work in less time.

It's easy to spend big chunks of your day writing emails. Yet I’m willing to bet that you haven’t thought about improving this important skill. 

Let me guess. You’ve sent emails to the following people without ever receiving replies: potential clients, people you admire and hoped to befriend, and colleagues or customers you wanted to support or serve.

If they had responded to your emails, it would have meant:

- More money 
- The chance to explore your best ideas 
- New connections and friendships with people you respect
- Less back-and-forth hassle and time-wasting

In short, a better working life.  

Email is one of the biggest daily interactions in your career that somehow goes unnoticed. We think they happen "behind the scenes," so they don’t really matter. 
 
But the opportunities you missed out on are just half the story. 

You also hated the process of seeking out these opportunities. Emails take a long time to write and can frustrate the hell out of you. Sending emails can feel like grinding away on an endless to-do list, leaving you feeling like a spammy robot.

But what if you enjoyed the process? What if you knew you were delivering value and helping every person you emailed? Sure, you’d earn more money, but imagine if emails also stopped feeling like a chore and instead, became a source of strength for your company.

I know emails aren’t your favorite topic; they’re not mine either. That’s why this book is short. Who wants to read a textbook when you just need help writing an email to a potential client? You’re busy. You have enough to do. 

This book is designed to be a companion to your email writing process –  something you can open up next to Gmail and use for quick reference.

To help you find what you’re looking for, I’ve ordered the book chronologically. How to start writing is at the beginning. How to end your emails well is near the end. 

School, your parents and other well-meaning mentors taught you to do things one way. They showed you how to sell yourself – often at the expense of what your clients need. This book teaches the opposite. Consider it a reset button.

If you don’t want to make more money or free up more time in your day, then this isn't the book for you.

Results speak for themselves. I hope you use this book to unlock your dream clients and projects. If you do, please email me. If you’ve implemented what you read in the book, I’d like to hear from you.

# Why Emails that win you clients?

## The story not often told.

It must be tough for clients. 

They’re tossed into the web world that even professional designers and developers don’t fully understand.

They hire someone to create, in a few weeks or months of work, something that their business will depend on every day, forever.

We’ve all heard client horror stories shared Twitter or websites like Clients From Hell. Now it’s time to share the other side.

My friend Loren owns a sushi catering business in Oceanside, California. It’s called the Sushi Bus, because every weekday, he packs up his business and drives somewhere new to sell sushi. 

It’s a small business, but he’s able to live off the money he makes. His typical work day is 12 hours long. He works 12 pm - 12 am. He doesn’t have much free time. 

Instead, his team of chefs focus solely on the art of sushi. They masterfully infuse Mexican, North American, and Vietnamese recipes into their dishes. They are true masters of their craft and dedicate more time to their work than any freelancer I’ve known. Loren barely has time to check his email.

Still, it’s a thriving business. Dozens of people ask every day how they can find out where the sushi bus will be next. Customers literally pull out their phones and hand them to Loren, asking to follow the Sushi Bus on Twitter. The problem is, they don’t have an online presence. The Sushi Bus isn’t on Twitter. 

So, Loren decided to change that. He did some homework and researched how to get a website built. He posted the job on a freelance board and was soon inundated with replies from website designers and developers. 

Unfortunately, he couldn’t tell them apart. Every email included portfolio and website links, resumes, phone numbers, and more. The applicants used words like “conversion rate,” “php,” “pixel-perfection,” and “mailing lists.” Words he didn’t understand. 

Some of the emails were so long that Loren didn’t even have time to read them. He didn’t know what to do. 

Had even one freelancer mentioned how a great website could open new doors for his business, Loren would have invested immediately. Loren knew a website could help, but he didn’t know how. He didn’t know, because no one told him. 

All he needed to hear was that a mailing list would instantly tell hundreds of hungry fans where to find his bus during their lunch breaks. This would have made total sense to Loren, and he would’ve happily opened his wallet, knowing he would make the money back every time he sent out one of these emails. 

Instead, all the freelancers spoke a foreign language. He felt excluded. He felt like an outsider. His business, his livelihood, and his potential all suffered that day. 

If you replied to his job post, you missed out on a great client. 

That’s the story freelancers don’t share on Twitter. That’s the story this book aims to re-write. 


# You don’t need many clients

## It only takes one to end your dry spell.

Most people do nothing when they run out of work. They simply sit and wait. 

Others post on Twitter and update their portfolios. These tasks feel like work, but they won’t get you paid. 

So why do we focus on them? The reason is pretty simple: we’re not used to being direct. We’re used to marketing created by the big guys. They talk to all of us at once, because they need millions of customers. 

But you don’t. 

You have an advantage. You have a much clearer path. You earn money by getting paying clients, so all you need is a handful of customers.

Unlike the big guys, you can afford to get direct with your marketing. You can invest your time and resources in straight-up communication.

You can weigh and measure all of your actions according to how they help you achieve your goal of **getting paid by clients**. You can ask yourself at any time, “is this directly helping me to reach my goal?”

You can clearly decide which activities are a total waste of time by asking, “has doing this landed me any clients?”

That’s why sending emails has a bigger effect on your career than any other activity. It’s time to do it better. 

Many freelancers complain that there’s not enough work to go around – that every online source of work is already inundated, but think about that for a second.

There are thousands of job boards on the web, listing thousands of jobs, and millions of people who need a problem solved. Even if you found just one potential client each day, that would would add up to over 20 per month.

If you emailed all 20 people this month, using the techniques outlined in this book, you’re almost guaranteed to land one – and that’s only taking job boards into account. The chips are in your favor. 

You need fewer clients (and prospects) than you think.

# Being first doesn’t matter
## Getting an upper-hand on everyone else.

A lot of freelancers look at a job board site and think:  
> *“Why bother? I won’t be the first person in line. There are bound to be hundreds of more experienced freelancers who reply to this posting. I don’t have a chance.”*

The truth is, being first means you’re just slightly ahead of a huge wave of people. That’s not a great position.

People who post on job boards get a lot of replies, it’s true. But when they get hundreds of replies, they have to take a step back to process it all. The responses can be overwhelming. 
They might even delay the project for a few weeks or months until they can sort out this whole hiring business. 
That’s when it happens. No one who gets a ton of email and thinks they’ll go back and read them all, ever actually does. 
In this case, being first is actually irrelevant. Your email stands apart from the herd if it lags behind by a few days (or even weeks). 
It’s true, you can’t know the perfect time to email someone. **But being first doesn’t matter.**

As the phrase goes, you can recognise a pioneer from the arrows in his back.” – Des Traynor, Inside Intercom Blog*


# Start right here 
## How to keep your email out of the trash.

The world is full of spam. When someone first opens an email (or reads a subject line), they’re thinking, “is this spam?”

Address this problem upfront. How can you make sure they know your email isn’t spam? Remember that each client you email is potentially worth thousands of dollars, and you only need a handful of clients to make a lot of money. Spend time on them.

So how can you invest your time or money upfront to prove your email isn’t spam? 

Has the recipient written a book or blog post you can read? If so, buy their damn book. Learn their name. Address your recipient by that name. Make a connection.

Lead with something you really love about their company. Authenticity means discovering what YOU think is great about them and sharing it sincerely.

Remember, as your future client reads each sentence, they only have two options: 

1. Stop reading. 
2. Keep reading. 

Step into their shoes and address the fact that their inbox is full of spam. It’s the best way to ensure they keep reading. 



# Don’t try to convince anyone
## What not to say at the beginning of your email.

You should always respect your recipient’s inbox, but don’t sell yourself short in the process. Don’t try to convince them of something. 

If they’re looking for a local freelancer, don’t say, *“I know I’m not local, but remote freelancing really works!”* 

Don’t argue. You can’t convince them. If you want to approach someone, even though you don’t meet a specific requirement, that’s perfectly acceptable – especially if you know you can help them. Don’t let some small detail on their job post stop you. 

Just don’t mention that detail. 

If you don’t want to reply through the job board form, that’s fine. Go outside of it. Find the person’s email. Don’t be scared that you’ll piss them off in the process. It won’t happen. 
In fact, it will separate you from the pack. It will prove you care. So do the extra work.

And by the way, doing the extra work also means:

- You learn more about them by reading tweets, blog posts, etc
- You already know them (and their work) more intimately
- You have more ammo to build a real connection


# Start at the end
## How to not send babbling, unsolicited emails.

We’ve all had writer’s block. Emailing a potential client is hard. You don’t know what to say. You ramble. You end your email ambiguously, because you don’t know what else to do. That means you end up sending unsolicited, unfocused emails that attempt to:
- Exhibit your expertise
- Leverage your personality or charm
- Share your background info
- Entice them to buy your service
- Show examples of past work
- Give them your resume

The list goes on and on...

These are all the wrong things to do. You’re not going to charm someone into hiring you. In fact, most of what I listed above has no business in a cold email.

There’s only one purpose. There’s only one outcome you can hope for, which is getting someone to read and reply to your email. That’s the definition of a win in the cold emailing game.

Don’t focus on anything else. 

Think about the point of your email. What do you want? Get specific, then write it down:

> *“I want this person to be my client”*

Wrong. Not specific enough.

> *“I want Bob to reply to my email so I can show him how to use this plugin that will help him make a lot of money.”* 

Good – and will likely get a reply.

If you don’t think about what you want from the email BEFORE you send it, you’ll start at the top. And the top is typically a greeting and your life story. Too much information.

Instead start at the end. Start with what you want to do, and how that will help your potential client. 



# Get to the point
## Stop rambling and write clearly. 

So many emails blab on and on. Who cares what they actually say, because no one reads them. They’re lost forever. 
And good riddance.

You won’t be there to explain your email, so make it easy to understand. 

Don’t ramble. 

*“Here are some random thoughts…”* are the worst five words you can use in an email. I don’t want random thoughts. I just want to read your damn email and get on with my life.

So, what are you talking about? Talk about that.

Imagine *you’re* getting the email, and constantly ask yourself: *“can you hurry up and get to the point?”*

It’s the best way to add clarity, because it’s measurable. Don’t tell me you’re better than the rest. Tell me why I should care. 

This is critical. Get to the core of what the client wants. Give them instructions. Remove clutter. Make sure every sentence in the email reinforces your next step. 


# What most people send
## How to avoid sending the same email everyone else sent already.

Most people are extremely predictable. At least 90% send the same email to potential clients, word for word.

> *SUBJECT: I’m a world-class (or some other exaggerated term) freelancer or consultancy.*

Hold it. Let’s stop right there. What the hell is a world-class WordPress development agency? This isn’t the Olympics. If you’re using some exaggerated title to sell yourself in the subject, you’ve already lost. Still, when the poor sap opens the email it continues:

> Hello, I’m Robert Williams, the lead developer for (agency name). We’re the leading WordPress agency in (city), and we want to work with the best WordPress sites on the internet.

Whoa, that’s a lot of of jargon. It ignores the fact that we all have our own problems. Your credit card is maxed out, your income taxes are due, your stocks took a tumble yesterday, you upset your SO by forgetting your anniversary, and to top it all off, your doctor just called to tell you you have high blood pressure – not to mention dandruff.

Next, you open this email and some sales guy is yapping about what his company wants? He wants to work with the best WordPress websites? Who cares what he wants?

> *We’ve been developing award-winning WordPress sites since 2004, as a top agency year after year. Many clients and agencies around the world have used our development expertise to create a wide variety of sites. Our development skill set includes: wordpress (obviously), html5, css3, responsive design, php, jquery, and mysql.*

Did you even finish reading that? Or did you see a list of skills and immediately skip it? Fuck that shit. And you’re inside this industry. You actually know what those terms mean and you STILL skipped the fuck out of them.
 
Someone who isn’t in the industry might be shocked to know that they even give awards for websites (pretty stupid in my opinion). 

The person who wrote this email is trying to prove they’re big and rich and on top. So what? As a client, you couldn’t care less about PHP. You have no clue what PHP even means. You’re a 10x developer? WTF is that? Nobody cares if you’re the PHP whisperer. After all, how does it help the person reading the email? 

It doesn’t. The person reading the email only cares about himself, not the person sending the email. The more the sender talks about himself, the more the reader starts to feel small and unimportant. 

> *To get to know me better, I would encourage you to check out my website, as well as my LinkedIn profile:  http://mywebsite.com http://linkedin.com/rob*

Ah yes, the standard, “here’s my website.” What are the chances you click on this thing (besides to peep at it for a sec)? Pretty low. Why? Because you’re the one getting the email. You shouldn’t have to make the effort. Especially since it’s so much easier to delete this email. You’re busy. You’re not interested in looking at some dumbass LinkedIn profile, even if the sender thinks he’s Don Draper.

> *Here are three recent sites that I developed in WordPress: http://siteone.com http://sitetwo.com http://sitethree.com*

You’re probably looking to hire a WordPress developer because you don’t know shit about WordPress. How will looking at “recent” sites help you? You’re probably not trained in design, development or anything else related to websites, but suddenly you’re supposed to be impressed?

> *Let me know if you think our businesses might be a good fit. I look forward to hearing from you and learning how we can best work together. If you can email me back this week to discuss this further, that will be mutually beneficial.  – Robert*

Okay, so in addition to all of your stress, job pressure, and daily annoyances, I have the balls to ask you to look at my business and see if I can help you. 

You’re probably just as busy as I am (or at least you like to think you are) and now you have to cut time out of your schedule to hunt down, compare and analyse our two businesses – and with a time limit, no less. Fat fucking chance. 

When someone says that a vague partnership will be *“mutually beneficial,”* it’s pretty clear they mean that it will help them, not you. 

By the way, did I mention how often people send this kind of email? If it’s the exact same email you just wrote to a client today, don’t feel bad.

If you’re not hearing back from potential clients, it isn’t because you’re a bad person or a lousy freelancer; it’s because of the emails you’re writing.

Let’s change them.


# Make the world better with your emails
## How to ensure people enjoy reading what you write.  

Naturally, our favorite topic is ourselves – especially when we’re writing emails. Why? It’s easy.

Talking about ourselves is easy because we know ourselves. It’s even easier to fall into this trap when we’re emailing in order to get something we want. Seeing what we want, right in front of us, is intoxicating. It blinds us with shiny desire.

Writing about yourself is intuitive because it feels safer. You’re risk-averse and you don’t want to lose the carrot hanging in front of you, so you don’t make any assumptions about the person you’re emailing. After all, you can’t be wrong if you talk about what you know: yourself. You are your favorite topic!

There’s just one problem: you’re not anyone else’s favorite topic. Their favorite topic is themselves. Every day, people send millions of emails that no one wants to read, because they’re created for the writer, not the reader. 

If opening your email felt more like checking the snail mail for something awesome from Amazon and less like digging through the trash, the world would be a better place. If every email you sent contained something awesome that the recipient deeply wanted, everyone would look forward to your emails.

After all, if you only received emails with something delightful inside (instead of crappy messages that blabbed on about the sender), you’d look forward to checking your inbox, too. 


# You’re not alone
## Why most emails never get replies.

When you sit down to email a potential client, you’re focused on you. You want that new contract. You want to end your dry spell. You want more consulting work. 

Those “wants” come through in your email. Most people send emails focused on themselves. They talk about their talents. They link to their portfolios. They end the email by telling the client how to get in touch. It’s like they’re all alone in the conversation. 

Writing emails for yourself doesn’t consider the other person in the equation – and that one-sided attitude comes through in every form of marketing.

For example, why do freelancers always brag that they *“build awesome websites for small businesses.”*

Instead, why don’t they *“build small websites for awesome businesses”*?

After all, it’s not about you or your websites.

You’re not in a vacuum. Someone else is hiring you. It’s about them. They need something from you. If you think:

- It’s hard to find work 
 - It’s hard to find the right fit 
- Projects drag on too long.
- Projects always go over budget

You’re not alone. Clients are tired of this, too, but freelancers never address these problems.

They’re too busy worrying about getting enough work and why no one is hiring them to make something awesome. They never turn it around to realize that if they’re not getting hired to make something awesome, it means a client doesn’t get that awesome thing, either.

# Address that clients have a shitty deal, too
## How all projects seem to start.

Sometimes, client work can make you sick. With every blown deadline and client snafu, it’s easy to hate some parts of the process. But realize that clients often hate their end of the bargain, too. 

At the beginning of most projects, they get:

- a mysterious price tag
- a long, non-specific timeline
- no guarantees it will succeed

Address these issues directly. Provide a timeframe for your project. Give them a free sample. Make working with you a no-brainer. Redefine what they need. Take these steps and you’ll create better clients for life. 

After all, most projects start out the same: 

- There’s an inquiry, usually via personal referral, job post, RFP, etc. 
- Next, you qualify the person and the project. You discuss what a mutually beneficial relationship would look like (typically over email).
- Then you close. Once you agree there’s a fit, you have to line up the numbers and determine the scope. 

Since all projects start out the same way, it’s easy to look at the difference between freelancers who succeed and freelancers who struggle at each step. Extract the patterns. 

For example, when freelancers run out of work, they get stuck on step one. They go to message boards and hacker news and ask, *“what’s the best job board for freelancers?”*

Successful freelancers know the truth: there isn’t one. That’s why everyone who’s looking for the best job board is struggling. It’s the wrong question. Don’t ask it.

Instead, ask how you can deliver more value. Look for opportunities to quickly give clients what they need.


# Just make the problem go away
## The fastest way to win over a client.

When you’re about to contact a lead, think about how you can make their problem go away. Don’t worry about giving away the farm. In fact, if it makes sense, give them the solution for free. This is how you separate yourself from the pack. 

Most businesses already do this, because it works. Basecamp lets you use their service free for 30 days. Costco gives you free samples around every corner. Give a sample of yourself away, too. 

If you can save a client time, do it. It’s much better than claiming you can help them, because you’ve just proved it. 
Take work away from your clients. Make smart decisions for them and put the burden on yourself to prove that you can help. Ask yourself:

- What do they need to get done? 
- What’s most important to them? 
- Why do they need this?

Ignore everything else. 

Instead of worrying about money at this point, think about how you can do some version of what they want for free. 

Can you take care of their problem by sending this one email?
If so, do it every time.

# When they’re too vague
## How to connect with people even when you don’t have much to work with.

Most job posts include a contact name or email address. It’s rare that they don’t also include the business name. This is all the information you need to do a short recon mission. 

Find the company founder online. Read his or her blog. Read their Twitter feed. Find business details that you can reference in your email. 

- How big is the company?
- What kind of website do they have?
- Can you tell what it runs on?

Even with basic information, you can extract potential solutions and phrase them in ways that are almost guaranteed to elicit interest. For example:

> *”Because you have 13 locations across one state, I suspect you need a streamlined way to do X, which would benefit your company by taking care of Y."*

Even if you're not 100% sure about what they want or need, your words show that you're thinking strategically about their business.

Most freelancers won’t take this step because they think they don’t have enough time. You can, because you realize that you only need a few clients. A 10 - 20 minute investment in some basic research can lead to thousands of dollars in client work. 

Even if you were unable to find *any* information about the company or the person you were contacting, you still have their job post.

Use their words. People are literally telling you what they need. Repeat those words back to them – and you don’t have to get fancy. Using their words in your email is usually better than coming up with something on your own, especially if you don’t have much background info.

# Write about them
## Where to spend your time when writing an email.

A while back, I took a good look at my daily work time. At least 80% of it was spent writing. A blog post here, an email there, some typing in a chatroom, and bam – most of my day was gone.

No matter how much you hate writing, I’m betting your days are much the same. Your business runs on your writing. Your website, your work, and your emails; they’re all based on writing. 

In order to present your value, you need to focus on your writing. It’s the activity that already occupies most of your time.

But don’t get me wrong. Although you’re at the center of all this writing, you need to focus on something else in order to improve it. You need to dedicate your time to learning about the person you’re emailing. Their wants. Their needs. 

I didn’t call this book “send great emails,” because that’s not what you want. Likewise, you shouldn’t send emails saying, “I’m a great freelancer,” because a great freelancer is not what people want to buy.


# Not set in stone
## Why some people triple their client’s budget while others give discounts.

If you’re waiting for leads to come in with huge budgets and specification lists that perfectly match your skills, forget about it. Not going to happen.

Still, most freelancers get hung up on this fantasy. The truth is, if you’re a consultant, a big part of your work includes educating your clients. In fact, a job post or another form of outreach is basically just a way to ask for help finding the right solution.

The most successful consultants get it. Instead of complaining about low budgets, they show clients that they have their best interests at heart.

Instead of discussing the price of open heart surgery, they discuss whether the client needs the surgery at all.

If you approach a client and question whether they even need your service, you immediately put them in a position to fight for what they want. If they’re price-conscious, suggest a smaller project.

This way, you can wow them with a shockingly low sticker price and build their trust by demonstrating that you won’t sell them more than they need. Yes, you’ll get less upfront revenue, but you’re proving that you’re on their side. You increase the odds that they’ll hire you again.

You might lose a few thousand dollars by suggesting a cheaper route, but you’ll get that 10 or 20 times over on the backend when they realize you were right. After all, would you rather work with someone who’s going to nickel and dime you, or someone who truly has your best interest at heart?

I thought so.

# Sell an outcome
## Why your portfolio doesn’t help you win work.

Your portfolio sucks. Even if it’s full of great work, it’s boring. No one wants to look at it. Except you. I don’t care about your history or background. The only thing I’m less interested in is your resume. 

No one is going to read a 10-page proposal about you and your awesome websites. People don’t want websites. They don’t want to hire a freelancer. They want something to happen. They want a result. 

**So focus on selling that.** 

Your work can’t sell itself because it puts the cart before the horse. You’re not addressing a client’s needs with portfolio screenshots of your work. It’s like sending your mom in to sing your praises after a job interview. Not good. 

A portfolio doesn’t build a relationship. Instead, it says “check this shit out. Pretty sweet, huh?”

Add more context. How does that screenshot of your work highlight what your customer cares about? Will they even understand what you’re showing them?

If you had to remove the words “I,” “me,” or “my” in the email and replace them with “you,” what would you say?

> *I’ve helped hundreds of businesses in your position. I helped X-company to accomplish Y-benefit.*

Would become:

> *Your website reminds me of X-company, which probably means you want Y-benefit as well.*

What’s the benefit?

Christensen, Integrating Around Jobs To Be Done*

# Your client DGAF
## Why you should write shorter emails.

Reading is work. It’s your job to help your clients avoid unnecessary work. Writing shorter emails is the easiest way to get people to read and reply to what you write. Do that and you’ll immediately send better emails.

It might seem counter-intuitive. You know your service will deliver a huge ROI for your client. In your mind, it doesn’t make sense not to care.

That’s why you write long emails describing every inch of your work history and past accomplishments. These long, unfocused emails are inconsiderate. They force their way into the reader’s world. They demand to be read.

They’re shitty.

Write shorter emails.

# Short emails can be shitty, too
## Length doesn’t matter on bad emails.

In the introduction, I mentioned my service, [Workshop], which is a daily newsletter I send to freelancers that contains a list of the day’s best freelance opportunities on the web.
 
Recently, my friend Brennan used Workshop to find a freelancer. One of the people who responded sent the following email:

> Subject: Freelancer  Body: Hi, i'm replying to your post looking for a freelancer.

When I say you should write shorter emails, this is not what I’m talking about. Putting zero effort into the email is a waste of time. Don’t send anything, because you won’t get anything back.

Most freelancers, however, do the opposite. They send emails like this one (which I received from a freelance accountant):

(img)

A huge wall of text demonstrates a lack of consideration for the reader – not only because it’s ridiculously hard to read, but because the mere sight of it destroys your will to live. 

This email killed any chance he had of getting hired, even before I read what he had to say. That’s not what you want.

If he had taken just a few moments to format and edit the email, he could potentially have made hundreds or thousands of dollars.

# Write like a human 
## Why you shouldn’t use scripts.

When you tell the love of your life how you feel, it’s real. When you look your parents in the eyes and thank them for raising you, its real.

You didn’t pull those words from a blog post, they were real. Be real. Real is better.

But most freelancers send incredibly generic emails. 

You didn’t become a freelancer to lose your soul. You didn’t start a consultancy to speak like a robot. Don’t become something you’re not.

When someone is speaking from the heart, you can tell. You can also smell when they don’t fully believe what they’re saying.

Authenticity is obvious. This holds true, even in emails. Write the way you talk. If you can’t hear yourself saying the words in your email, change them.

- Avoid scripts 
- Cut the jargon and vague promises 
- Remove industry terms. 
- Delete stuff no one gives a shit about, i.e. anything that doesn’t directly affect them


# I repeat: don’t use scripts 
## Stop forcing yourself to send bad emails.

Bad emails focus on the sender. You can send them to anyone, because the reader is irrelevant. Templates and scripts are, by definition, meant for hundreds, if not thousands of people. 

But you’re not writing to thousands of people. You are writing to one person. That’s what makes email one of the most effective forms of marketing on the planet. Don’t abandon that opportunity. The same principle has driven advertising for over 30 years. 

> *“Do not address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your website they are alone. Pretend you are writing each of them a letter. One human being to another, second person singular." – David Ogilvy, Ogilvy on Advertising*

Write like you’re speaking to one person, because that’s exactly what you’re doing. 


# Get rid of the bullshit
## Use real terms that everyone understands.

To a client, you’re not a chief UX research officer, you’re the guy who improves their website or decides what to put on their website. Don’t hide. It’s better to be that guy, anyway. 

In fact, niche it down even further. What are you really good at building? Instead of being the guy who makes websites, become the guy who’s really good at testing what to put on the website. 

There’s power in specificity. Just don’t get cute. Use real words, not ego-boosting job titles. 

I see way too many websites that say, “we build digital experiences,” or “I’m a digital storyteller,” or use some other fluffy, nondescript language.

If I were a client arriving on this page, I’d think “shoot! I just want a new website,” and close the page – totally missing the fact that these websites could help me. 

If you build websites, you build websites. You don’t craft digital experiences. Pretend you’re explaining it to a five-year-old. That’s how the world will appreciate it. You only have someone’s attention for a few seconds. You only have one chance to connect with them. They won’t immediately understand what you’re trying to say, unless you use familiar words and phrases. 

Speak to clients so they can understand you. Cut the fluff – and the bullshit. 


# Who’s we?
## Don’t try to sound bigger than you are

When you hear the voice-over in a radio commercial say, “we provide excellent services,” what’s your first thought? Mine’s, “Ugh. Another shitty random company.”

But what if you heard your barber or dentist say, “Hey there! It’s time to come see me!” That would be an instant connection. 
Unless you’re referring to someone specific when you say “we,” and the person you’re emailing knows who that is, it’s just confusing. If you’d say “I” on the phone, write that in your email instead. 

Saying “we” is a way to avoid getting personal. You’re scared that if clients knew you were just a guy on the computer, your business would collapse. 

The opposite is usually true. By trying to sound bigger than you are, clients can smell the inauthenticity. 

And what’s wrong with getting personal?


# Draw a line in the sand
## Say goodbye to the wrong clients to make way for the right ones. 

Late last year I made a big purchase. I needed a car. I decided on a Honda Accord. I read a great book on car buying. I loaded up on information. I learned how to negotiate at car dealerships. I wanted the best deal. 

Then, I started the process of buying a car. There was a lot of back and forth. Many emails were sent. I found several cars that were close to the one I wanted. There was a lot of wheeling and dealing.

Then I found the perfect car. It had everything I wanted, but the dealer wouldn’t negotiate. He explained it simply: “we price our cars at the lowest price all the time. Our customers love this about us. We hope you will too.” 

Negotiating no longer mattered, because he had exactly what I wanted. Sure, I probably could’ve paid a couple thousand dollars less, but I wouldn’t have been as happy with the car.

You want clients who want the service you provide, not people who are settling because you’re cheaper than the competition. In order to get these clients, you have to be okay with turning the others down. You have to be okay with saying, “if this isn’t right for you, I understand. I find it’s right for the customers I serve.”

# Your dream job
## You evolve with more information, so do it consciously. 

When I graduated, I wanted to work at an agency. Then I worked at one. I realized that I wouldn’t be in control of how much money I made and which projects I worked on. 

Since then, I’ve turned down multiple job offers from some of the country’s top agencies. Your dream job evolves with information.

As a freelancer, it’s up to you to get that information and control how you use it. Track your efforts. Most of us want to do things our way. Find a way to make that happen. 

- Count how many cold emails you send to land one client
- Hit that number every week
- Collect the leads you contact in a folder
- Go back to them later

Now that you have this information, your dream job will change again. Knowing how many cold emails you have to send to land one client may not seem hugely important. 

However, it’s the key to surviving as a freelancer. It’s one thing that can never be taken away. You can lose all your clients. Never see another referral. But as long as you hit the number, you’re guaranteed to land clients. Making sure you hit that number while enjoying your life becomes your dream job.

Only this time, it’s what *you* make it. 


# Avoid client repellent
## Don’t make it easy for clients to delete your email.

In a reader’s mind:

> *“Let me know how I can help…”*

Becomes:

> *“Anyway, this was a long brain dump of an email. Not sure what to say next, so I’ll just leave it up to you. What do you think?”*

I understand why you might write that to end a long email. It feels professional. What you’re saying, though, is anything but professional. 

You’re saying you can’t be bothered to figure out how you can help. You’re saying you can’t solve the problems you’re getting paid to solve. 

Ending an email with this phrase usually means you won’t get a reply. 

The reader thinks, “I’m not sure how you can help, either. I’ll give it some thought and get back to them.”

This. Never. Happens.

Your email will seep to the bottom of their inbox. It will turn cold, dusty, and gray. Weeks or months will pass. Occasionally, the recipient will see it and think, “Oh yeah, that email.”

Eventually it will start to chafe at them. Seeing it will bug them. Every passing day the question will loom, “what do I think?”

Until one day, they’ll shrug and say IDGAF and click delete. They will exhale and never think about you again.

# Make it easy to hire you
## Remove any obstacles that come between you and a positive reply.

People are more likely to do something when it’s easy. That’s why you’ve gotta make it easy to read and act on your emails:

- Break emails up into sections 
- Make them easy to scan by using lists and bolding key points
- Remove all links unless the client specifically requested them. You’re not trying to drive traffic to a website, you’re trying to get a reply
- Don’t send your entire portfolio. Break out 1-2 pieces that are relevant to their project 
- Match the benefits of your past work to their current needs 
- Remove any job board links. They know they posted on a job board 
- Don’t give them a long questionnaire to fill out. No one wants to do it 
- Use good grammar. Write simply and get straight to the point
- Once you’ve agreed on the price and scope, link them to an easy payment system, like Stripe, Shopify, or Gumroad.

A good rule of thumb: if someone can just reply “sounds good,” then your email does enough of the heavy lifting. 

It means you’ve taken away the hard part: deciding what’s next.
Even busy people will reply if you make it easy. 


# How to end an email
## Do 80% of the client’s work by outlining the next step.

Instead of repelling clients by asking an open-ended question, use a yes or no question. Why? A yes or no question does 80% of the work. 

It saves time. For example, closing an email with, “do you want to see some ideas I have for your site?” means someone just has to reply “sure.” Yet, you’re still giving them control. 

You’re prescribing a solution. Do this at the end of every email. It saves time for everyone, but if will feel unnatural at first. You’ll want to slip back into passive mode, because it feels like you’re barking orders. You’re not. You’re doing your job. 

This is how you will get clients to reply. Here’s what to include:

- The next step you recommend
- A second option, in case they don’t like your first one 

Lead up to this in part of your email… or make it the entire email. 

For example, if you’re trying to set the date and time for a meeting:

> *“Great! What time works for you?”*

Would become:

> *“Great! I’d love to chat on Tuesday, March 17th at 12 pm PST, but I’m also free Thursday and Friday pretty much all day. When works for you?”*

A cold email to a client would change from:

> *“Let me know if you think there’s a fit.”*

To:
	
> *“There are two ways we can move forward: I recommend we do X, because it would mean Y benefit.  If you don’t want to do that, then we can do X and still get Z benefit.  Sound good?”*

How many back-and-forth emails did I just save? A bazillion.


# You’re dealing with busy people
## How to get through to busy people. 

Busy people read emails differently.

1. They delete emails without reading them.
2. They archive them before reading. 

We think they’re reading every word, but they’re not. 

1. They scan. 
2. They look for the one question or sentence that sums up the purpose of the email. 

They’re constantly thinking, “what does this person want?” And, “does this matter to me?”

Help busy people to reply to your emails: 
	
1. Write simply, one to one. 
2. Keep it short. 75-100 words is plenty for a cold email.
3. Don’t hide the point of your email. Draw attention to it.


# Busy people put you in a folder
## Follow instructions and follow up.

Busy people put you in a folder. After they post a job, they dump all the applicants in a folder to look at later. 

Some people don’t even make it into the folder. Most job posts have clear instructions about how to apply. Busy people use these instructions as an easy way to sort through the herd.

The easiest way to get eliminated is to ignore these instructions. You don’t follow the instructions, you end up in the trash.

Once you’re in the folder, you’re only halfway there. You have to make it out of the folder. 

Want to stay there forever? Don’t follow up. If a client sends you an email saying they will follow up soon, that means it’s your job to touch base with them, because they will probably forget to do it. Then guess who will land the project? The person who followed up. 

Here’s a great example from e-commerce consultant Kurt Elster. If Kurt hasn’t heard back from a potential client in a week, he sends the following email:

> *“Since I have not heard from you on this, I have to assume your priorities have changed.”*

At least 50% of the time, Kurt gets a response. 

Note: Only write something like this if it has actually been more than a week since you sent the email. 



# Get testimonials and referrals
## By minimizing the client’s workload.

Minimizing your client’s workload doesn’t just help you land them, it also helps you land other clients. When I'm coming close to the end of a project, I'll send an email like this:

> *”Oh and by the way, I'm thinking of doing a case study about ProjectName on my website – with your permission. I would also love to include a testimonial from you about my work with :CompanyName: Something like this would be perfect:   “Using Robert's design services to create a website that measurably attracts more customers is a guaranteed investment. :ClientName: - Founder"  In fact, if you're busy at the moment, I can use that quote for now. Either way, let me know. Thank you!”*

This works for me 99% of the time, because all a busy client has to say is "yeah, sure," and bam – the work is done.

Once I get a testimonial (which is basically an endorsement to the whole world), I'll go in and ask directly for a referral:

> *Hey, Thanks for the testimonial. This was an awesome project.  I’d like to continue working with you. I have a few ideas for what we can do in the next few weeks to add to this project and make it even more successful.  I’ll send those over soon, but for now, if you know of anyone who would beneﬁt from a similar service, I would love it if you could send me their email. I’ll let them know that you were thinking this might be right for them, and answer any questions they have about how your project worked out (I'll also cc you on the email)!  Sound good?”*

Again, this approach does all the hard work for the client. They simply email me with a name, and I take care of the rest.

The truth is, that's what clients pay me to do – design strategies that deliver huge results (either in added revenue or time savings) – so I've just applied the same principles to my own business.



# What to do next
## Hitting send – and beyond.

You might be thinking, what do I do after I send a cold email? 

You don’t sit and wait. Cold emailing is a numbers game. A lot of the time, you won’t get a reply. It’s best not to put all of your email eggs in one basket. Applying all the strategies in this book will significantly increase your chance of hearing back, but there’s no way to guarantee that someone will reply to your email. 

You can follow up, but if you still don’t hear back, it’s usually best to just move on to the next lead. In some ways, cold emails are the new job interviews. We’re talking about modern-day interview etiquette here. 

Although you only need a handful of clients to be successful, one potential client won’t make or break you. You need to contact numerous people every week.

Here’s a quick checklist you can refer to before sending your next 10 emails. 

Make sure you:

- Deliver value as quickly as possible
- Focus on the client, not on yourself
- Sound like yourself
- Write as short an email as possible
- Make it dead-simple for the client to reply to by suggesting the next step (and an alternative) 

Throughout the past year-and-a-half, I’ve collected hundreds of different questions from freelancers and contractors, and I’ve put all the answers smack on one page. If you’re wondering about something, [you’ll probably find the answer right here].  


# On your marks...
## How to find 200+ leads this month

So now you understand how to send emails that win clients. You know what it takes to deliver value to a client – to focus on them and still sound like yourself. You’re prepared to avoid all the most common mistakes.

It’s so easy to spend huge chunks your day sending emails without ever thinking about how you could improve. Now you have a leg up on most other freelancers. 

Still, this advice is meaningless if you don’t use it. You might be thinking to yourself, “but I don’t have anyone to email. I don’t know how to find job leads.” 

It’s not as hard as you think. I find over 200 every month, in just a few hours a day. Here’s how I do it: 

1. Open up an RSS reader. Import all of the best job boards on the web. To save time, you can use this one.
2. Spend 30 minutes a day sorting through the postings to find the ones that apply to you. Look for people who need remote (non-local) freelancers. 
3. Do some background recon on the ones you want to contact. Get a name, photo, personal email, and links to relevant websites (blog, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).
4. Follow the strategies in this book and send a great email to one person every day.
