The most lucrative email you can send in the next 5 minutes.

## It's simple. Send a follow up email to ALL your past clients 

You might already be feeling some resistance to this idea, that’s good: this is the #1 most underutilized tactic.

See because you’re always on the lookout for more work, you don’t realize the number one most likely place to get work.

Even successful freelancers don’t do this enough. Find all of your clients from the past 2-3 years (you can even go beyond this). To find these all of these clients. 

- look at your bank account and sort by income
- Go to your stripe account and see who’s paid you
- Look at paypal, or your email address for “invoice”

I’m betting you’ll find one or two clients you forgot existed. 

You’ll quickly have over 10+ people who you probably haven’t followed up with recently, that’s OK. 

- Put them all on a list, a spreadsheet
-  Send them a super simple, quick email:


> Hey [first name], just wanted to follow up and see how your business is doing. Is there anything I can do to help grow your business? Give me a call if you need help :) Talk soon, [Your name] [Your Phone Number]


You’ll be amazed how well this works. You’ll undoubtably hear back from a few of them with urgent projects. These are highly-qualified people who are 10x more likely to hire you - yet you forget about them because you’re always looking for work.

We’ll talk about how to automate this in another lesson but this is how you create a recurring stream of clients coming to you, by simply sending a short email every 3 months.	

By BUILDING on what you establish, not constantly throwing away your hard work sweat and tears.

If you're a workshop customer I'll remind you to follow-up with these clients every 3 months.
