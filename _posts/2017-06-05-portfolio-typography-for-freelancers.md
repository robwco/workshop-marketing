There’s two things at the heart of design. Copywriting, and typography. Unsurprisingly both of these deal with words. 

Words are what our live revolve around. Think about the last time you bought, consumed, or enjoyed something. It’s very likely words were involved at some point in presenting this thing to you. 

Presenting the thing to you is what design is about. You can’t get to the buying, consuming or enjoying until you’ve been presented with words. 

Sure color, shapes, images, and all of these graphical elements play a role. But what we’re really trying to shape is words. Even a purely graphical design is trying to convey words you feel. 

Anyway, that’s getting kind of abstract. Let’s take a real example. Your clients. Throughout their engagement with you, they’re going to be confronted with words. 

Words you’ve created. These words are what will decide whether they buy from you, are happy with the work, or hate your guts and ask for a refund. 

Have you ever done some of your finest work in your career – only to feel nervous when it’s time to present to the client? (Worse, have you ever had that work rejected by the client?)

Why is that? If your work is so great why isn’t it enough to win over the client on it’s own?

At the end of the day the work doesn’t matter if you can’t get sell your ideas. You do that with words. 

So have you looked at the words you’ve used with clients lately? Are you calling them out or are you just going through the motions? 

The way you’re speaking  – is it because you’ve chosen it specifically – or because it’s just the way you think you should?

Look at the words on your website, in your emails, in your email signature, the words you use on sales calls, in your proposals – how are they helping present you?

Then comes the next questions – beyond even the content of these words, how are you presenting these words graphically. Are they all legible? Are they easy to read? Does their hierarchy make sense?

Or are you sending a 5000 word, un-formatted, rambling and 8 pt font sized hard to read email? (Didn’t realize that typography happens even in an email?)

Are you choosing each word you write? Are you choosing how to present these words?

If you’re not, you might be losing on one of the most important decisions you make in whether your business gets and finds clients. 

“Typography doesn’t matter.”
“Copywriting doesn’t matter.”
“Design doesn’t matter.”
