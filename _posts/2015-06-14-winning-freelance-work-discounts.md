I usually give them a quote but let them know that if it's outside their budget, I'm open to reducing the amount of hours or removing certain parts of the project in order to fit their budget range.

For the third, I usually ask for a ballpark. If I ask for the budget straight up - they usually ask me to come back with whatever I think it's gonna cost. Instead I ask them for a range - What are you looking to invest? (Always use invest instead of "spend"); Are we talking 5000, 10000 or 50000$? Then they say, well it's not 50000! Ok - is it closer to 10.000? Yes. 

Great - now I know that $10,000 isnt out of the scope so placing myself at $4,000 would be stupid at this point.

At the end of an initial discussion, I ask, "What were you looking to spend on this project?" Some people like to get cute and refuse to answer, so I'll press them on it but if they still won't, I say, "Similar projects in the past have been between $10K and $20K" and gauge their reaction. I won't waste my time writing anything down until I know what they want to spend and I'm sure it's reasonable. Otherwise it's like trying to sell a BMW to a hobo. Pointless.

This is a redflag: "I haven't worked on the CMS they're using, and can't really say how much time it would take me." I would either budget an extra 20% to cover your learning curve or turn the project down.

They key to lowering your rate and not coming off like you just inflate your prices for no reason is: don't lower your rates without getting something in return. For example, you could add a few stipulations to working at a discounted rate, and make sure the client acknowledges and agrees before continuing:

If the client is blown away by your work, they agree:

1. You will go back to your normal rate for all future projects.
1. They will refer you to 2 people who they know that might benefit from your services.
1. You will have rights to do a full case study and the client will provide any information you need.
1. The client will provide a testimonial upon completion of the project.
1. Obviously not all of those will apply, but you can add others that make more sense. I'd definitely keep #1 in there though.
