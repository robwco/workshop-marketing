# How to beat a long sales cycle

The truth about freelancing is that most projects take a really long time to get going. If you’ve ever sat on a committee or been on the client side of the project, you know decisions happen slowly over time.

That’s why a freelancer or agency who is able to survive and keep a relationship alive over the long-term is able to win client after client. 

See it’s not that you don’t say the right things or you’re not the right person to help them. It’s that you’re not there when it comes to time to actually hire someone. 

That’s why you want to make sure you maintain a relationship with as many clients as possible. However, this isn’t really possible all by yourself. You can’t maintain a relationship with hundreds of leads individually, there’s simply not enough time in the day. 

Instead what you have to do is find a way you deliver value to them over a long time in a repeatable and consistent way. 

I’ve found email courses are great for this. I’ve used email courses for my business since 2012 and they’v been the one thing that continues to sell my services while I sleep.

They talk to my customers for me. DELIVER A TON OF VALUE. Which establishes trust in their mind. Not only that but it creates a relationship where I’m giving them something. Something that they value. 

This is powerful. 

I’m able to deliver them something that they value, and by doing that I establish my expertise. They’re able to develop into my ideal clients, over time because I’m slowly training them. I’m slowly exhibiting expertise that would be IMPOSSIBLE for me to do over just one email. 

No while my competitors try to sell their service with one sales page or one cold email or one phone call. I’m selling to my clients over weeks and months and sometimes even YEARS. 

By the time they have an urgent need that they need me and my team on, I’m able to point back to the mountain of value I’ve already delivered. The things I’ve given them which they’ve already started using. 

The things I’ve given them which have already made an impact on how they operate their business. You don’t know how many times I’ve setup a meeting with a client, and they’ve mentioned that they have read a book or a blog post or an article I wrote. 

That’s powerful. Where someone else can only claim to know about their struggles. I’ve not only established I do, but I’ve provided fixes which have worked. How can that person compete with me when it’s time to hire someone?

Thats why you need an email course. Not only will clients hire you over the a long-term with an email course. They’ll be better clients. They will have already looked into your services, learned FROM you how to be a great client, and put it into practice. 

That’s one way how ideal clients are created. 

Now you might be saying I don’t know how to write an email course, or THIS doesn’t seem like a high priority right now.

I think both of those excuses are wrong.

First, I think you’ve probably already written your email course. If you have blog posts related to what you work on, case studies, portfolio pieces, or have read any books on what you do, the content for the email course is already created. 

It’s just waiting to be pruned. 

Now the reason why this is a high priority. Even if it doesn’t exactly result in clients RIGHT AWAY. Is because you’re building a business. You’re in this for the long haul. You’re not going to cash out in a couple years. Even if you were, to cash out you need assets. 

An email course is a business asset that will keep working for you. It’s something that you can use to find clients, and eventually even sell products too and create passive income. 

The first step is taking content which you’ve already created and packaging it into a course. Look through your past blog articles, curate them down to topics that clients would be interested in. 

Look at your case studies or past projects and see what decisions you made which results in success for your clients. Other people are supremely interested in this stuff. No matter how small, because it gives them an insight into how you think that they can use to improve their own business. 

Find ways that a client could come into your brain and steal all the value possible. For example, sell logos? Explain why the logos you  design are better. Then tell them exactly how you create logos. The easier to steal, the better. 

Don’t worry about giving this stuff away. The truth is a client isn’t going to be able to create their own logo no matter how simple you make it (and you want to make it as simple as possible) what they want is to understand!

Understanding and education is the key to creating the type son clients you want to work with. It’s the key to creating clients for life that don’t go away no matter what. Clients you can continue to work with for years. 

But it takes investing in yourself and in them now. You might be saying but wait how will I even get people on this email list in the first place (we’ll talk about that in a future lesson) but for now don’t worry about that. 

Email courses are loaded with value. Why? Because they’re so direct. Unlike a blog post, a tweet, or any other marketing you could do for your client service firm, an email course arrives directly in your client’s inbox. 

It has a special letter inside you wrote and it’s direct. It’s one to one. Freelancers and agencies should create email courses first. So you might be saying this sounds great but how exactly do I setup an email course that can do this? That’s what we’ll cover next.
