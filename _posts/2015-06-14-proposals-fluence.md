Fluence

Hi there Philip,

I’m the creative director of Tiny Anvil, a small web freelancing agency.

I’m a ravenously creative individual who thrives on learning and trying new things. I build most of my applications on my own, from start to finish. Idea inception to design execution.

My experience ranges from farm hand, to Pepsi merchandiser, to professional photographer, to front-end web designer & developer. I’ve worked for companies like Wrangler and the Navy on their advertising and web teams all the way down to pro bono print and video work for missionaries in Eastern Asia.

Here are a few of my own projects, apart from Tiny Anvil work.

Completed Projects

Thisimg - Personal photography webshop
Rest - Commercial blogging theme built with the Ghost CMS.
Elixir - Complex PHP/Javascript responsive image add-on for the Statamic CMS
Current Projects in Production

The Venue Co - Event photography webshop theme
Attn.io - Podcasting site
Providence - Church site
Online Profiles

Dribbble
GitHub
Be sure and take a look at these sites on different devices as well. I always design responsively and often start my projects at their smallest breakpoints first.

If any of these things interest you or are the type of design and development you’re looking to hire I’d love to set up a time to talk over your project specifics and answer any further questions you may have.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
