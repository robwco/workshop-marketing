# 3 ways to make sure you ACTUALLY find work every month 

So in the last video I talked about how you NEED at least 30 leads coming in each month if you want a healthy pipeline. 

If you haven’t seen that video, go back and watch it now at letsworkshop.com/1

So as i mention in that video 15 of those leads should be inbound (we’ll talk about how to get more inbound leads in a future video). 

But if you don’t have 15 inbound leads coming in that means the rest is UP TO YOU. 

you need to contact 15 new leads every month if you want to have a healthy pipeline of client work.

that’s 15 leads every month even when you’re already fully booked months out or really busy with other stuff

what this means is that you need to be emailing at least 4 leads per week. 

4 leads might seems like a low easy target and it is …

see the hard part won’t be the volume. 

it’ll be  the consistency. 

especially when you get tired, bored

or during times where you’re really busy and don’t have time to do it

so i’m going to share with you 3 ways you can make the 4 email a week challenge a breeze

## 1) first create a template. 

you don’t want to spend a lot of time on every single lead because, by definition, most leads won’t become clients. 

however, you do need to send something slightly personal to each lead. 

what i recommend doing is creating a basic 2-3 sentence email template

with 1 sentence that’s completely custom for each lead

that way you will connect with the client and not end up in the spam folder

remember you’re aiming for about 1 out of 15 people you email to become clients

make it easy to hit that 15 email goal every month

use your own words, use your real voice, and think about receiving this email from the client’s perspective

make them address the type of problems you solve for your clients

## 2) automate sending the email AND following up. 

I want to put emphasis on the follow up part. 

it’s better to email 3 leads and follow up with each one then to email 10 leads. 

that’s why i recommend you use software to ensure you follow up with every single lead.

there’s a bunch of tools that makes it automatic for you to follow up and you can even connect them to spreadsheets

the software i recommend is quickmail but there’s a ton of other ones you can use also like yesware and streak.

if you email me at robert@letsworkshop.com i’ll even send you a pre-filled quickmail template you can start from

that way you don’t have to worry about setting anything up. 

and you’ll be ready when you come across a lead

you’ll know that you just have to pour leads into the top of this machine

and clients will come out of the bottom like gooey goodness


## 3) lastly don’t do it yourself.

this outreach process is going to suck.

you’ll hate your life if you have to grind this out day after day. 

that’s fine for a little while, but once you start seeing results with your template and your system it’s time to outsource.

once you get a system in place that you’re comfortable with – and more important you know works

hire a va or an assistant to take over the process. 

that way you can remove yourself from the less enjoyable parts and instead focus ONLY on getting on sales calls and closing clients. 

picture yourself jumping on a call 4-5 times a week with a lead who’s been researched, qualified, and primed for becoming an excellent dream client of yours. 

that’s what you want to get to. 

that’s what i want to help you get to also. 

i’ve even offered a hands-on service that will not just handle finding leads for you but also the outreach, follow-ups, qualifying and scheduling for you.
