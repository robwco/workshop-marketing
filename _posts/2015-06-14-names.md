I get asked about how I named Workshop pretty often. The truth is I came up with the name Workshop before I even had the idea for the service. I thought it would make a cool name for something.

Why did it sound cool to me? I don't know. Part gut-feeling. Part being easy to remember. The fun part was once I had the idea for the service and needed a name, I remembered it. 

It happened to work on multiple levels. A 'workshop' is a place people go to manufacture goods. It's a place people go to work. People join my service to go to work also.

Plus, people use it to shop for work, so like a tire-shop sells tires, I sell work.

Although I'm glad the name works, it wasn't pre-meditated. That's one piece of advice I give people who are starting something new and stressing out about the name. 

Worry about the product or service first. Let that guide the name, and don't over think it.

If you're buying a domain before you've even really mapped out the idea, you're probably on the wrong track. Take a step back and focus on solving something. The name will come.
