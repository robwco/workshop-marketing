On Friday, I followed emailed this lead on: http://www.wphired.com/wordpress-jobs/word-press-expert/

I emailed her my standard cold email with example projects and closing with the ask: "It's okay to say no but if you do see a fit, Iâ€™d like to discuss the details of your project next week. I have time for a call Monday afternoon, does that work for you? If not, then the follow morning also works."

The immediate reply I got was, "Yes.... You sound very expensive?" which is really confusing because I didn't mention prices at all, I just gave three example projects. So basically she's saying, "Oh, I see you're experienced, so obviously you're expensive." Not cool.

Since I don't want she considers expensive, I explain, "With no minimum commitments, I offer ongoing support at $174/hour. Changing content, adding features, or running updates is as easy as sending us an email. Most support requests are completed same day, often within an hour."

Immediately she tried to neg me with, "Sorry you are overpriced for the market." after admitting I seemed expensive/intimidating/experienced. This super annoyed me. The truth is I'm more than she's willing to pay, and she has no idea how fast I do or don't work.

I know I should have walked away at this point, but it's good practice, so I replied again, "I appreciate your candor. If I lowered my rates, I wouldn't be able to offer the talent, resources, and service that result in satisfied clients and winning projects."

She replied again with this red flag throwdown: "Perhaps you do not understand what I need. I do the copy I do the seo...You just put together the look and feel. I could not charge for my work if you charged that much for yours. I will call you." and she did call me but I didn't answer because I didn't want to work with her. I just wanted to a good lesson in beating price objections.
