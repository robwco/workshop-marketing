Getting a budget is always annoying. It’s all about how you frame it. I ask, “What have you budgeted to ensure a successful outcome?” or the more casual, “There’s a couple options, what are you looking to spend?”

If they play coy, I sympathize and say, "This question tends to make people nervous. I’ve had clients flat out refuse to tell me, with the explanation that if they disclose that information I’ll just tell them that’s what the work will cost. That’s partially true. I’ll tell you what you can get for that amount. Then we can talk about whether you actually need that much budget or not. But most of all, what that number tells me is how to guide you toward the appropriate solution for you, and to stay away from solutions that are outside of your price range.” (Go ahead and save that in your email swipe file, I swiped it from Mike Monteiro myself.)

If they still won’t say after that, they’re playing hardball. That’s okay, we can play hardball too while remaining professional and establishing our expertise. You say, “Well, similar past projects I’ve worked on required XX hours to be successful, so I would expect a budget of at least $20 thousand.” At that point, they’ll either agree with you or shit their pants.

We've also had good success with "what kind of investment are you looking to make?"

There's also "does this feel like a $5,000, $50,000 or $500,000 project to you?" That one has floated around in Workshop discussions before, and can be a good way of getting someone reluctant to talk about money to react and give some feedback that you can use to start a discussion.

I think we all tend to hit a lot of potential clients that are like this. I've worked with some non-profits in the last year with the same budget constraints and I'll bend, to a point.

When presented with the "Our budget is tight," "There's just no money in our budget," "Or, we're really not sure" it can be frustrating. I go back and forth on this, but I explain as in the article that was posted, why I need to get an idea of their budget ceiling is.

So I may say something like:
"Look, I understand talking about budget is tricky because it's hard to figure out exactly what your costs are. If you can give me an idea of your budget ceiling, I can get an idea of just how much of X, Y and Z you need."

OR

"We're in the same place as you. We didn't get to where we're at by not being careful with our money, as well. So we understand budget concerns. If you can let me in on what you're working with, we can take it from there and put together a realistic solution for you."

Obviously, these things are to be "seasoned-to-taste" but in many of my own scenarios stern empathy works a treat. I've also worked in "sticker shock therapy" to, to see if they blink. What is your budget ceiling for this project. 10k? 20k? More? Are we in the same range, here? That kills the dance pretty quickly and allows me to have a real discussion. If people still won't answer or be willing to have an honest discussion then I pretty much move on. "Help me help you," that's what this discussion comes down to.

I think that my qualifying process helps me get around the conversations before they need to happen, but if not, this what I usually do.

You've probably felt sick of client work at some point. 


Those big projects where you suddenly realize you didn’t quite end up at the result you envisioned when you began the project. Where precise project outlines were riddled with shitty client feedback and late email responses. If so, I’m not surprised. That dissatisfaction is pretty common among freelancers.

But hold on. Consider for a second that clients may get sick of their end of the deal too.

After all, if you look at it from their perspective, it wasn’t a very settling offer to jump into. At the start, they were forced to buy this vague thing you call a “service.” You slapped a mysterious price tag on it of somewhere between a first-class plane ticket and a small home, with seemingly no reasoning behind arriving at this number. The price also came packaged with a 6-24 month delivery timeline, and absolutely zero guarantee that it would help the client’s business in any way. That’s a pretty awful fucking deal.

Long and short of it... What your client thinks is an acceptable rate for an hourly service might not actually equate to what they are willing to pay for a 15-page website. $80 an hour sounds very different from $X,XXX for the complete project from start to finish.

Unless I'm doing in-house work for an agency as a subcontractor, I don't do hourly rates. In my experience (others may have a different experience), people who have 9-5 jobs at companies and corporations tend to balk at $75-$100/hr rates. They don't have the necessary experience of being a freelancer or small business owner to understand what this rate breaks down to after expenses, taxes, etc.

I always approach my own client work from a fixed-cost perspective at first, and include an hourly rate for additional work beyond the scope of my proposal.

In situations like that (assuming you want the work -- ask to see the wireframes) I try to come back with a fixed price for version 1 and then an hourly rate for updates and changes. At 2 hours per page you'd be looking at 900 or so with their rate. I would think you (of all people) could do this in 15 hours (perhaps less) or so and I would charge $1000 for the 15 pages, which would pay you about 66/hr, if not more.

Personally, I would respond with something along the lines of "I think I can help you with your project, but not at that rate. This is what I can do…" and then lay out your proposal.

You'd be crazy to buy that on amazon. 
Freelancers don’t address this hole in their service offering very much. Instead we scratch our heads and wonder why so many prospects never become paying clients.

Here are three key steps to starting a project, and how you come off to a client who is trying to pay you money:

1. **Inquiry:** The most common way an inquiry happens is through a contact page, job board, or referral. If it’s a contact form or job board, the client has to deal with sorting through horrendous amounts of spam. Canned responses and bad “Dear Business owner” emails flood their inbox and are almost painful enough to cancel the project entirely and give up on humanity. There are other options, like RFP’s, but they all follow the same idea and have similar results.

1. **Qualifying:** Once an initial inquiry has been made by either party, decisions need to be made. Usually the client will pick a few applicants out and offer to discuss what a mutually beneficial relationship could look like. This initial selection is usually pretty easy because so many freelancers are bad at sending emails. Being slightly better than them makes you stand out.At this stage, the client’s main concern is return on investment and growing their business. They literally can’t afford to concern themselves with anything else. So it’s frustrating for them to ask about these things only to get vague answers. When a client asks a freelancer about price, it’s usually like opening up pandora’s box. There’s a mixture of nervousness, anxiety, and a hint of pretentiousness over the thought of giving a specific price at the beginning of a complicated project. A client will usually come away from the conversation with very little resolve or understanding about what the project will cost.

1. **Closing:**  Success! They’ve identified at least one freelancer who’s a perfect match for their company. They don’t know what it’s going to cost, how long it will take, or if the freelancer’s expertise will actually help their business, but besides that, it’s a perfect match! Now a freelancer will typically send a 10-page contract for the client to sign protecting them from every possible scenario in which a client could screw them over. (The contract defines screwing over as attempting to get what the client paid for.)

Now obviously this story is one-sided. Don’t get me wrong, I never recommend giving a specific price if it’s too early in the process and you don’t know enough about the project. But ideally, qualifying is all about asking questions–and still many freelancers skip this step entirely.

It helps to look at it from a client’s perspective and realize they’re asking about price because that’s what’s important to them. Put yourself in their shoes. Wouldn’t you ask the same question if it was your money? If you were to ask a doctor how much open-heart surgery would cost, he could tell you, but there would also probably be a length discussion about whether you need the surgery, right? Instead of having a client “trust us” that the project is going to be a big win, how can we show them we have their best interest at heart by questioning whether they need a huge project at all?

Maybe it’s our fault that the projects we try to estimate and price are too large to give any sort of realistic budget or timeframe. Why not try to redefine what the client thinks they need (and in the process give a shockingly low sticker price)? Why not redesign one page on their website instead of the whole thing?
