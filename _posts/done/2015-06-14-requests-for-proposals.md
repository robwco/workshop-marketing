Any RFP I'm interested in, I ask them one simple question. If they can answer it directly, I'll move forward. If not, I move on. In the last year, I've responded to two formal RFPs. I lost both.

The truth of RFPs is they're usually written with an agency in mind. I know, I've been the guy they were written for before.

RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don't even want to do it... they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap... just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don't have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit's their budget plan.

As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It's nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky!

For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it's an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I'm a big fan of guaranteed income.

Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances.

The people who do the best with RFP's (and are actually the people who've made $100k+ from workshop) are the ones who have a system in place for replying to RFP's specifically. They either hire someone to help, or have developed such a templated and refined process that they can do it themselves in a fraction of the time. This usually means they see it as a numbers game and don't sweat it when they don't hear back.
