When a client asks what it will cost to make a change to their website in the future or "down the road," what they're really asking is if they can trust that you won't disappear the minute you hand off the project. They want to know you won't leave them out to dry.

This creates a perfect opportunity to up-sell a retainer agreement because you can position the retainer as a premium way of ensuring you're available to them if they need help:

> "For small maintenance updates like that it would probably be best to do some sort of small retainer. For example, some of my clients pay $X00 every month to have me on call for up to 4 hours. They have that time reserved just for them no matter what.

>Otherwise, I'd still be able to do pretty much any small updates you need (at my normal $X00 hourly rate) â€“ you would just need to wait in my queue if I have other clients.

>For companies of your size I usually recommend option 1 because I can sometimes be booked weeks or months in advanced, and in that case, updates wouldn't be as fast to get done (with option 2)."

This positions you as a very in-demand freelancer yet you also get to remain flexible to their needs. It's great to have a handful of clients paying hundreds of dollars every month for minimal work too because you can count on that revenue. 

In fact, recurring revenue like this is great for freelancing in general because it kills feast or famine.
