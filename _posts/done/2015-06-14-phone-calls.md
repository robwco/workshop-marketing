<span class="run-in"><span>F</span>reelancers often forget</span> that simple verbal communication is often the most powerful way to get your point across.

And when it comes to collecting money, you want to make sure your message comes across clearly.

###Here's how using the phone can get your invoices paid:

1. __Have basic etiquette__  
Part of me feels silly even having to write this section, but I have often found myself on the other end of (what should be) professional phone calls with a person who has ZERO phone etiquette, and it never ceases to amaze me. So here are some of the important basics to start us off:  
  - Never eat or drink when on the phone.
  - Speak clearly and speak up.  
  - Answer the phone professionally (stating your name or company name).  
  - Conversely, when calling a client identify yourself and your company. 
  - Never interrupt the person you are talking to. Don’t use speakerphone (if you can avoid it).  
We've all been on the wrong end of phone calls when a person doesn't have basic phone etiquette. It’s maddening. So don’t be that guy. No one likes that guy. That guy has no friends.
2. __Practice, Practice, Practice!__  
It is so easy to just send an email to your clients rather than pick up the phone. Add the stress of following up on overdue payments to that, and most people are going to avoid it completely. To get over that, practicing:
  - A good way to start is to set phone goals for yourself. 
  - Start out simple. Make 1 or so cold sales call a day for a week. 
  - Find potential clients and just pick up the phone and talk to them about using your service. 
  - After that try 2-3 cold calls a day for a week.
This way you can practice getting over that phone anxiety. Even if you flub the call, you aren’t talking to an all-important client, it's a complete stranger. If it works out, you may have a new client on your hands. It’s a win-win! The more you find yourself on the phone, the sooner you’ll see that phone anxiety disappear. When you do have to call your clients regarding that overdue payment, it won’t seem nearly as awkward.  
3. __Keep it professional__ 
This is especially important if you are calling your client to discuss payment. While the topic of money can often make people feel awkward or uncomfortable or even heated (if we are talking about a non-payer), it is important to remember you are representing your business. Keep the conversation calm and professional at all times. Emotion has no place in the conversation.  
The plus side to being on the phone in these situations is that the person on the other end can’t see you. If you find yourself getting nervous, angry, upset, or anxious, they never needs to know. If you keep your voice and tone calm and your words professional, the client will have no idea there is any stress on your end. Just remember, if your client is truly trying to get out of paying you, they WANT you to lose your cool. They are hoping that the conversation will become uncomfortable and awkward for you. Keeping it professional keeps YOU in control.  
4. __Know what you are going to say before you call__
Before you even pick up the phone, know what you want to say. This may sound obvious, but when calling about things like money and past due invoices, the conversation can quickly feel uncomfortable. So the last thing you want is to lose your place. Forgetting the points you want to make to your client makes you look unprepared and unprofessional. If you aren’t able to be direct about your intentions when calling, you are making it easier for them to continue to blow off your payment.  
_Note: If you are feeling anxiety you may even want to take it a step further and write down the points you want to make on the phone. And be prepared for their possible responses. If you’ve thought out (and written down) your talking points and possible responses you’ll sound confident and prepared when making that phone call. This will again help you maintain control._
5. __Follow up’s and voicemails__   
When you are calling a client and they don’t answer, be prepared to leave a detailed voicemail message. Get right to the point of your call and leave all of your contact information. Nothing more. When calling about payments follow up a voicemail message with an email as well. If you are calling about a non-payment keep in mind that most of the time your client is not being malicious. They truly may have just overlooked your invoice. If you call and leave a voicemail, and follow up with an email including another copy of the invoice and link to pay, that may get them to pay you as soon as they get your message. If they really did simply forget they may want to pay quickly to avoid having the embarrassing conversation about non-payment. If you think this might be the case, you can easily send a light email reminding them to pay with the link after you have left your voicemail message. If they still don’t respond, you’ll know where they stand on payment and you can decide what your next steps are.

While these tips are designed to help you should you have to call your client and discuss late or non-payments, I would suggest that you talk to your clients on the phone regularly before anything like this ever happens. All too often I am hired to do AR work for people, and they give me a phone number and say, “I THINK this is the correct phone number. I’ve never actually called them before.” From a customer service aspect you should be reaching out to your clients through more than just email. Schedule phone, Skype or in person meetings (if possible) to strengthen your relationships. Not only does this help your customer service levels to soar in your clients eyes, but it makes you a real person to your client. Not just someone they only chat with via email. It is much harder to blow off payments to someone that you talk to over the phone or in person. Now get on that phone and get paid!
