> “I won't touch projects that have budgets smaller than $30,000. Anything lower is usually low-quality and unprofitable for me.”

That's a statement I get periodically from freelancers who pay me to send them leads. I'm not sure why $30,000 is the magical number for quality and profit but apparently it is.

But what I really don't get about this statement is that it's usually coming from a freelancer, aka a one-person business, who's overhead costs are essentially zero (yes I know you pay $20/month for project management software). 

Couple that with the fact that these people claim to be "desperate for work" and sometimes even in a dry spell and it's even more confusing. Still most of these freelancers "won't touch" a large portion of potential projects because initial budgets are too low. 

To me, this is outrageous. In what world are we living where a $5,000-$10,000 project is unprofitable for  one-person? Is the problem here really a dollar amount that's too low, or is it that you don't know how to make a project of any size profitable?

### The big problem with big budgets

Sure 5-figure projects look great at first. You've got a far away deadline and a big wad of cash. At the start, the possibilities seem endless. However, these big projects also end up hurting freelancers.

For one, the big price tag pushes hiring companies into thinking they own you. You're simply more demanding when you're paying more money and unless you're actively pushing back on this, you'll naturally give in to more client requests for the same reason.

That's when you feel scope creep start to kick in. You feel pressure to say yes to features and other requests that you don’t truly believe should be implemented because hey you're getting paid a small fortune.

People naturally want more bang for their buck. When you finally deliver the work, there’s endless revisions. Deadlines come and go without actually shipping anything. Projects drag on and on. Each day carving both you and your client's profitability away.

That's why if you're not able to make a $5,000 project profitable, you're less likely to make a larger, more complicated project profitable.  

After all, what exactly about a larger amount of work is easier to scope out and turn a profit on? Larger projects are by definition harder to make profitable because there's more work to... try make profitable. 

That's why I think freelancers should focus on making smaller projects more profitable before they move on to large ones. If you can make a 5,000 projects profitable for you and your clients, you can also make a 5-figure budget profitable for you and your clients.

### What are you delivering?

You might think everything you're delivering on those big $30k+ projects is essential. However, have you really examined what exactly is bringing your costs up so high that you can only afford to take on 5-figure projects?

I think you'll find most of your budget goes to:

- Research
- Meetings
- Proposals
- Presentations
- Revisions
- Exploration
- Outsourcing
- Emailing
- and Following up

What if you cut the bulk of these costs and replaced them with nothing? Would the client be worse off? If not, then you should do it. 

It will make your business more viable. It will make your client's business more viable. It'll give you less of a headache. You'll be able to focus on things that actually matter instead of fluff. 

Won't cutting these things make you less money?

No. Everything listed above is also hard to quantify. That's why it's hard to scope a large project accurately. You might think these things all carry a high margin but I disagree. 

I think if you really examined them, you'd find out they're not that profitable for you either. The work that matters is what's implemented. Do more of that and less of everything else.

Productize the way you present stuff, ask for feedback, onboard your clients and more. Create a better experience for them by systemizing the way clients work with you.

### Decide what matters.

So how can taking less money be a good idea?

Here’s a quote from a [great reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/35lpsc/i_charge_30k60k_for_wordpress_websites_with_a/) about a guy who’s charging $50,000 for simple Wordpress websites with nothing much to them. Nothing much except what matters. 

> Should customers care about brand? Yes. But should they care about it more than sales? 80% of businesses fail in the first year, and I’m guessing a big part of it is paying someone $50 an hour to make a 10 page website that generates a net zero result for their business.

This is a great point. Yes the point of this reddit thread is that he charges even more than $30,000 dollars but what's important is that he's focusing on value. 

If you can accomplish the same results by focusing only on what matters you can charge more. You can also make all projects more profitable.

The key is figuring out what is valuable to client. To start limit your work to two things. Things that will either:

1. Make them more money. 
2. Save them more money. 

Can you find ways to work for less and still make it more profitable?



### Present it as a package.

That's what some high-value consultants are doing. 

1. [Jarrod Drysdale will create an extremely affordable landing page that converts for you in a day.](http://landingpageinaday.com)
2. [Kurt Elster will makes your ecommerce site make more money than it does now.](http://websiterescues.com)
3. [Nick Disabato will tear down your site's usability for $600.](https://draft.nu/revise/express/)

These are all world-class designers charging less then a few thousand dollars for a valuable service. These are services that are profitable for a business of any size. (Even freelancers could benefit from hiring them at this price.)

Which is an interesting point. 

Have you ever considered hiring a freelancer like you for $30,000? Why not? 

If it's truly a great investment why aren't you paying for it?

As a B2B service provider, it’s also in your best interest to make sure your service provides a profit for your clients.

That’s why it’s important to ask if the money you’re getting paid is a sound investment for the company who’s hiring you. By taking it are you really helping the company you’re being hired to help?

Maybe that kind of self-critical price analysis is what we should be doing with our service on a normal basis. 

That’s why I think dabbling in creating a service offering where you’re actually charging less is smart. Especially if it means you’re working with a company you can actually help.

It would allow you to say no to more projects. It would open you up to working with different types of businesses that could have never afforded you before.

Clients you might actually enjoy working with.

### Next step for you

There’s never been a better time to be a designer or developer. You’re in demand. You build websites and apps and things that are valuable. So valuable in fact, people will pay you a lot of money.

(While I do agree that some highly-specialized consultants shouldn't work for less than $X0,000 – I don't think that's the case for 90% of people. Probably including you.)

Of course you should always charge more. Of course you should double your rate today. Of course. 

But maybe the current pricing model for freelancing is not all it’s cracked up to be in the long run.

Ask yourself:

- What would you do if instead you had to make a $3k project profitable?
- Specifically, what would you have to cut out?
- Would it make sense to hire yourself? Could you afford it? 
- Why not? How will the type of project you usually get hired for not be profitable for you as a client?

Can you change that?
