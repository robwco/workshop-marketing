A few weeks ago, I sent a wireframe to a client and asked for their feedback. Although I tried to guide them on what I was looking for, my wireframes were met with 20-something bullet-points on what "needed" to be changed.

There was no mention of the reasoning or the problems they were trying to solve with the prescribed solutions, just a list of instructions.

It would have been easy for me to blame the client, tell them to find another monkey, then go pout with my designer buddies — but instead I decided it was my fault. No one knows how to give good feedback instinctively. It's just not something we're born with.

I ended up creating a special document for my clients that went into detail on how to give effective feedback. I've since added it to every single new project and routinely send it to my clients as a reminder on how to discuss my work. I've saved a ton of time from it. My clients have too. 

It's yours free. 

[Send your clients to this page](/feedback/client-cheatsheet) or [send them the PDF version](/downloads/feedback.pdf)

It tells you exactly what you should and shouldn't do in order to give damn good feedback on even the most complex freelance projects. All I ask is that if you really like it, make sure to share it with your friends and tell them how you found it.
