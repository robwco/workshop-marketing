Hi Melinda,

I was looking through your RFP, and noticed the following:
"A better system to find and remove duplicate records, including when participants initially sign up for trips and classes.”

I have to say that you don’t have to deal with that problem in the first place. The system should be build not allowing duplicates, that way you’ll spend no time removing them. I’m working with Ruby on Rails, and it is a problem unheard of there.

Would you be interested in discussing it further? Would Friday 3pm CST work for you?

Thanks.

Hey Dmitry, wow! great email. 

Especially before the sentence "I’m working with Ruby on Rails, and it is a problem unheard of there." 

I'd remove this part because it opens up a can of worms. as a reader it makes me think "why is it unheard of?" "what is ruby on rails?" "how much is switching my entire system to it going to cost me?"

instead i want to be thinking "ahhh i will no longer worry about duplicated at all" which is what your email was doing up until this point. 

did you hear back to this email?
