I used to be polite to a fault. I didn't want to ruffle any feathers. I wanted everyone to like me. That was the worst thing I could do for my business because it let people intimidate me.

Since then, I've mastered three simple tools for avoiding intimidation:

1. No. 
The most powerful tool you have as a freelancer is your ability to say no. You can walk away from most bad situations with a no. Use it.

1. Honesty
Your second most powerful tool is the truth. Be honest, direct and straightforward. If someone has a bad idea, tell them. If someone's budget is too low, tell them.

1. Asking
Ask for what you want. Today a vendor called me and offered me a reseller agreement. Sign my clients up for their service, and I'd get paid 15%. My immediate response, "Can you do 20%?" They didn't get mad or hang up. They agreed.

Take the initiative to stand up for yourself. Once you start running your business from a position of strength, you'll quickly start seeing the rewards.

A suggested lesson from that that I've had to learn too - don't apologize for things that aren't your fault. Certainly provide friendly service to resolve them, but it's risky to take responsibility for things you don't have control over. I've found it doesn't appease difficult people (they just grab hold of blaming you) and more reasonable/honest people may see it as trite, since they know it's not your doing.
