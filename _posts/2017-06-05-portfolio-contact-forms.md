Set up your qualifying so that it happens while you sleep. One of the best thing you can do is create form on your website that qualifies your clients. Make it ask all of the the potential clients every question you need to know in order to make sure they’re your ideal client. This makes it easy to keep track of their answers and spit them back at them throughout the closing process to increase your close rate. In a later lesson we’ll talk about how you can automate these questions. 

Setup your contact form to have questions. You can do this in Wufoo or Typeform. Have it be 7 questions they need to fill out in order to get in contact with you. Why 7? 7 is enough that not just anyone will fill it out and waste your time. Only truly interested leads will be able to fill in 7 whole answers. 

You’ll get answers the you can use. There’s a wide array of questions you could ask, but I recommend the 7 value discovering questions by Sean Mccabe, theres also 7 qualifying questions by Dan mall. 

For this example I use Seanwes’s 7 questions. Once you have these questions in your wufoo form you’ll now be able to use them as you go through the sales process. 

Customize these questions, it’s going to be your process. Every lead is going to fill these out

Add a personal twist to these questions. This will be secret sauce. Clients will tell you they feel like you’re reading their mind, when really you’re reading their answers that you just had the foresight to ask. 

Asking these questions is a way of delivering value in itself. Next we’re going to talk about ways to automate this

## Why your contact form should be the center of your service business. 

You’ve probably felt what I call lead fatigue. Sure, some months it feels like you can’t find a single person who’s interested in your service.

But then there’s some months that your head is spinning because you can’t keep track of the 30 or so leads. 

- Someone from your contact form. 
- Another one from a friend on slack. 
- Another who got referred to you from past client
- Even another who replied to an old email you sent

This isn’t just going to change. It’s the feast or famine cycle. You can’t possibly email, chat, call or followup with all of these opportunities. Not only that but you can’t create a brand new process to accommodate each of these.

You need one system, that all of these leads go through to make sure you get the highest number of great clients coming out at the other end.

I recommend this being your contact form. Why your contact form?	Your contact form is public. People are ready to use it (or they’re already using it). It makes sense in any situation. They’re requesting help (a project and FIGURING out what they need from a project)

Who should you send to it?

-	Everyone

The only way to truly create a great customer on boarding experience is to make it be the same for everyone. No matter what type of project they have, or where they’re coming in from they have to fill out your form in order to get a project with you. They can be outbound leads, inbound, referrals, past clients, it doesn’t matter. You need to know the same things for every single new project, make sure you get them 

## Automating a followup to inbound leads who use the contact form. 
So you’ve gotten leads to answer your 7 questions. Awesome! These questions are going to be the cornerstone of the discussion you have with your clients Now you know exactly what they need, and how to talk about their project using words THEY have. 

But it’s not time yet to dive into scheduling up a call. First you’re going to want to make sure only qualified people make it into the process. For this I recommend you add one more thing to your form. A dropdown that they can choose between what their budget is. Decide what’s the minimum amount you’re interested in doing work for. This will be your floor.

Deciding on your floor can be hard especially when you’re low on work – and it WILL vary for everyone depending on what you do but I recommend at least 5 thousands dollars. 


Have 4 options:

- Below your floor
- Your floor 
- Double your floor
- 10X your floor


Now you can segment the two groups:

- When clients choose less than you’re floor they’re automatically hit up with an email that says:

> Hey Robert, I checked out your website and within a few minutes I noticed a handful of marketing tactics that you aren't leveraging, but should. Almost all of the tactics I would start off with are discussed in my free webinar at http://neilpatel.com. You should first check that out as you can grow your business without spending thousands in consulting fees each month. In addition to that you should check out my Advanced Marketing Program, which I discuss on the webinar.

This will turn them away in a way that: 

1. Still delivers them value 
2. And B) Keeps them in your sales funnel so that they can buy from you in the future

When a client chooses something inside of your floor that’s when it’s safe to say you can talk with them:

Send them a quick email saying: 

> Hey Robert, I checked out your site and within minutes loved what your’e doing. I think we may potentially be a match but even if we’re not I would love to point you in the right direction, grab a time to chat off my calendly link here?
> 
> It’s time to put them on the campaign that we discuss in module X that will schedule a call
