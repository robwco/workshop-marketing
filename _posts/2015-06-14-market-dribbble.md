The best place for discovering great design.
High quality design on dribbble can be found quite easily.
The popular page is work that has been vetted by the design community and passed the judgmental eyes of other talented designers. It’s a great place to check out what your competitors are doing.
You can do this by simply searching a
few key words and being presented with hundreds of high quality designs related
to your search. It can give you inspiration and excitement about the project which you are about to undertake. This is one reason designers use it daily as motivation.
What makes dribbble great for designers also makes it hard to use for recruiting. A designer will only post the coolest looking snapshots, so you wont get to see problem solving or strategic thinking on dribbble, only the execution of design minutiae.
Browsing the work is easy and fun (and addictively time consuming - so make sure you’re on your toes when visiting the site).
Particularly if you’re looking for inspiration regarding a particular style, dribbble is a great place to go because it has plenty of designers and fine artists who specialize in a particular look or style and have become famous for that style.
For example, if you’re looking for grunge illustrations, simply search that term in dribbble and you will find hundreds of designs that fit that style.
Dribbble is about details and a lot of the time designers who have simply stunning work
on dribbble, don’t have the necesarry project management skills, and/or business savvy for handling freelance projects, so that’s why I suggest startups go to folyo if their looking to hire designers.
