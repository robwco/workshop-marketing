Hi John, I read your article about X and I noticed that you're looking to optimize your website for conversions. 

I've been doing landing page optimization for some great startups the past 3 years and I'd like to offer to help you redesign your website and optimize it for conversions. 

That would make your users have a better experience, make you look more professional, get more conversions and leads, and you'd free up time that you could use to focus on creating new content X. 

We can discuss the details, of course, but first I wanted to see if this is something you might be interested in. 

If so, would it be okay if I sent you a few ideas on how I could help?
