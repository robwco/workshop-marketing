Freelancer and agency websites are often pretty complicated. We spend weeks tweaking, and twerking each individual portfolio piece. Crafting each line, stroke. Making the code nice and clean. 

But let’s hold on one second. Is all of this extra work really necessary? Is each extra hour you spend on your portfolio website actually giving you more results? Or is it just wasted time? The law of diminishing returns says it’s probably not the most effective use of your time. 

So what if you could use a one page website? What if your page adapted to whoever was visiting and the stage they were in. You would only have to link to one place, and yet prospects would get one message, while clients got another. 

It’s possible. One idea for this you can do is using your Email provider to segment people. Now the setup I’m talking about here is really paired down and I’m not suggesting it for everybody, but I just want to illustrate a point, of how simple your website can be, while still generating results for you. 

Using Drip and a tool like Drip Pro Tools (link included at the bottom of this lesson) you can have a website that re-molds itself to your visitor. In other words, you’ll be adding tags to people who visit your website based on if they’ve completed certain tasks. Like, are they on your mailing list? Have they submitted a project quote request? Do you know their name or their favorite color? 

You can customize your website based on all of these factors. 

For example, I like to show anyone who’s not on my mailing list a sign up form. While people who are on it, get a link to one of my products. The possibilities are endless but I do recommend you spend some time thinking about how you can use these principles for your business. To start here’s the form I recommend you go with. 

If the visitor is completely anonymous, they haven’t signed up to your list they haven’t been cookied. I give them my standard generic form:

Hello! I’m Robert. Let’s get started - would you like to receive my email course? (If no, my project quote form is on the next page)
Name
Project
Budget
Email
Newsletter option

I also include a message saying they’ll be able to create a project quote on the next page, incase they’re looking for that.

Once they submit this information I tag them as stage-2 prospects in my email system. This lets me know their email has been submitted so I can keep track at which point of my funnel people are falling off. 

Next I use some of their info to pre-populate the next form

Hey John! 

Eager to help you take care of your rails projects. If you want to talk about your project more deeply here’s my project quote form. 
1. What does success look like for this project?
2. How can failure be avoided with this project?
3. What will happen to your business if nothing changes?
4. Where do you see your business a year from now? Three years from now? 10 years from now?
5. Why did you come to me specifically?
6. What is the single most difficult thing in your business right now?
7. Why are you moving forward with this project now?

Once you get these answers you know that someone is very interested and whether they’re highly-qualified or not. You can really lean into their answers as you sell the project to them. They’v specifically telling you exactly what they want to hear from you. 

Don’t be shy about that. 

Once they’ve completed these questions. We’re going to assume they either become your client or they don’t but come back to your website for some reason. If that’s the case then they’ll see the same project quote request form. 

If they never became a client they can fill that out and submit a new project. If they do become a client they will receive a new form:

“Hey Dave! Anything I can do to help Widget Co.?
[Text box]

Here’s some of my info incase that’s what you’re looking for:
Robert Williams
555-555-5555
PO BOX 963
New York City, NY 90103”

What this does is show the right people the right message at the right time. I think you’d see better results with a  smart website like this than a website you’re constantly tweaking and changing. 

It can literally be this simple. Now of course you can change this and make it your own but it really doesn’t need to be any more complicated. You’re placing barrier around your time with this approach. People know they have to put in some effort to get to closer to you. That’s who you raise the perceived value. 

I’d keep the customization to a minimum at first. Only use the bare essentials but don’t be afraid to throw one or two pieces of pzaz into the form that will help you show your personality and stand out.

People who come to your website will usually have one thing in mind depending on their buying cycle. If they’re interested in working with you then they probably want to learn more about you. The best way to do that is to sign up for your email list, so that’s what you’re offering those people. 

If they’re ready to buy from you than it’s probably best that you get more information about their project before you jump into a call so you can deliver them more value. These people get your project discovery questions. That will let you go into your meeting ready to drop a value bomb on them. 

Returning clients are probably interested in getting in contact with you for some reason or they’re checking your website for information that they need - so you give these things to them upfront and center. The consideration one feels when someone has taken the time to think about you and your situation is truly a great feeling and it’ll help you win more clients. Much better than a perfectly crafted portfolio website that doesn’t tel m anything about you or your work
