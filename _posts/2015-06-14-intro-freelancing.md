# Why do dry spells happen to good people?
When you're in a dry spell an untimely bill could put your checking account in the red at any moment. This pokes holes in our income, business trajectory, and sanity. Yet most freelancers don't know the true cause.



## It's not why you think. Dry spells are NOT a natural part of freelancing. 
Every sales cycle has natural ebbs and flows - BUT long periods without work don't occur just because. They happen because of inaction.

Think back to the last time you didn't have any work. While this time probably sucked, it also probably kicked your butt into high gear. 

In fact, that's probably the last time you dedicated whole days to looking for work.

On the other hand, once a dry spell is over things can also go "too well". Have you ever had more clients come to you than you can handle?

It seems like work always comes in bunches and leaves you thinking: "Oh sure, NOW everyone wants to hire me. Where were all of these clients 2 weeks ago?"

The truth is, though, you caused it. If you hadn't waited until you had no work to start a mad dash of client outreach, you could have totally avoided it.

## Dry spells actually begin when you're fully-booked!
See, just like you suck at estimating how long a client project will take, you also suck at estimating how long the income you just got will sustain you. (Hint: always less than you think.)

Although it seems like being fully-booked will last forever, the truth is if you don’t keep looking for opportunities when you have work, dry spells are closer than you think.

The trick is not waiting until you're out of work to do something about them.

If you were to keep contacting new opportunities you'd be able to negotiate and say no to projects from a position of power. That's hard to do when you are starving for work. 

## That’s why you should keep emailing leads even when you’re booked... even up to 6 months in advanced.
It sounds simple but it's actually difficult to find these leads when you're also busy with client work.

And forcing yourself to keep up with an endless treadmill of sales activity isn't the answer either. 

You need a system that you can follow effortlessly, no matter how busy you are.

You're already running a consultancy, adding another chore to that won't help... but I will.

## I'll send you 8-12 high-quality freelance leads that you can email right now and win work from.
There’s no strings attached and nothing between you and the clients I send. You can email them directly from your inbox and start winning work today. 

Why am I doing this? It's something I wish I had when I was freelancing. I wanted to build a stable, profitable business but sales were daunting. It would take me hours to find just one qualified lead. It's not worth your time.

All I ask is if you find work from one of the free leads I send you, you let me know so I can ask you a few questions about how you did it. 

Again it's absolutely free, and I've hand-checked each lead for quality to make sure they're 1) looking for a freelancer, not an employee 2) open to working remotely with a freelancer anywhere and 3) have a budget of at least $1000.

After I send the leads I'll also show you how I find hundreds of high-quality leads using 100% free tools. So you can do it yourself. It's a system I've built that will walk you through how to go from paycheck-to-paycheck freelancing to booked 6-12 months in advanced.
