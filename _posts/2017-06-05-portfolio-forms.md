Pushing clients to this contact from via outreach. Now that you’ve got this form setup you might be saying cool my work is done.

Not so fast. 

You need people to actually answer the questions or else it’s useless. Yes, some organic traffic might end up filling out this form naturally. 

But my favorite way to get people to fill it out is to actually force them. All of your leads, in order to get on a call with you MUST first fill out this form. 

This is now the standard, only way people can get on a call with you they MUST answer these questions. You see you don’t want to spend time on people who aren’t serious.

If they can’t fill out a form they won’t buy from you. As you go through the outreach lessons in the course, once you send a cold email that gets a response, then deliver value and get them interested, you’re going to want to push them to this form.

Like literally link them to this form. You’ll also do this with all referrals, and leads from your network. This is YOUR process. You need clients who are going to stick to it
