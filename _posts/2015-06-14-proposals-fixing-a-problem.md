Stopping auto-redirects

Hi Tim,

Since I’m unable to reproduce the problem, I believe that the best way of dealing with it would be paying a customer that’s experiencing the problem to record traffic (using Charles trace) and send it to you. Then I would be able to analyse the page and provide the evidence of redirects, if any.

If you have any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them. My Skype id is dmitry.maksyoma, my rate is $70/hour.

Thanks.
