Eileen, I have some ideas on your RFP budget

Hey Eileen, 

Your RFP says you need X, which I don't recommend at for your budget. With your budget trying to get all X features would probably mean a lower quality developer who would do Y.

Instead, here's some of the features you mentioned which could get done at your budget, feature A, feature B, and feature C. These things are the core of what you're looking for so you still get Z benefit. 

Can I send over some more ideas for how to save on the project and still get what you need done?
