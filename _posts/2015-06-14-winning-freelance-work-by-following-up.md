I've never been good at touching base. As a freelancer, this has cost me dearly. After all, you might not win business on the first contact with a prospect. It may take many touches to enter a business relationship.

One of my follow up success stories is from a few years ago. I recently moved to Japan and met up with another software developer living in the area who I met on an online forum.

We didn't keep in touch but 9 months later, I sent him an email out of the blue seeing how he was doing. He had started his own software consultancy in the meantime and replied:

> "By the way: I've been searching for a developer to help me (short term) on some projects, and I totally forgot to ask you."

Since then, that relationship has resulted in $36,225.83 worth of business. Not bad for one follow up email.

A couple months ago, Robert sent out an email to Shed subscribers titled "What should I do RIGHT NOW to get an inbox full of clients later?" He showed how he sets up a label for prospects to remind himself to follow up. I saw how this is a huge problem for myself and other freelancers. There could be thousands of dollars in opportunities sitting in your email but they end up slipping away unless you have an easy follow up reminder system.

So I built [https://touchingbase.io](https://touchingbase.io/) to help freelancers and consultants stay in touch with prospects and clients without the huge time hassle of setting up and using a CRM. I just launched it a couple weeks ago and have gotten some pretty good feedback on it.

If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.
