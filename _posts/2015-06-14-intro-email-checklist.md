A lot of freelancers get hung up on knowing exactly what to say to a new prospect that they're cold emailing. With the limitless options to what you can include in a cold email, it can be a daunting task. 

That's why I've developed the cold email checklist after years testing and seeing thousands of emails from freelancers get ignored to. 

The first step is to just dive in and write a quick, short rough draft email to your prospect. For more help with that, check out my book <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Emails That Win You Clients</a>.

### Once you have your first draft email written, you can apply a few quick rules to it to make sure you're maximizing your response rate:

The subject line should be so specific it could only be sent to one person in the world.

This will make sure your email gets opened because busy people look to remove spam first.

The length of a cold email should be under 120 words.

Busy people don't have time to read much. Make it simple, crisp, and get to the point.

Your email should provide something of value.

Would you be happy to receive this email, even if you had no intention of hiring someone? Delivering advice or tips is an easy way to show you're on the client's side.

Don't include links to your social media or portfolio.

A prospective client doesn't really care about your work... at least not yet. The only point of this first email is to get them to reply so making them click on your website, linkedin profile or portfolio doesn't help you.

It should be easy to find the point of your email.

Someone using a job board probably has a lot of email responses and is more likely to scan and look for the next step. Make that part of your email easy to find. Bold it if you have to.

The end of your email should be easy to reply to in seconds.

You don't want to give a busy lead more work. If the lead can say "sounds good" you're probably on the right track.

If your email passes all of these rules, it is probably ready to send and you'll have a 30-50% chance of response form a client. That's just a response. 

You still have to land one of these, so that still leaves you begging the question. how do I find a list of prospects I can email on everyday?
