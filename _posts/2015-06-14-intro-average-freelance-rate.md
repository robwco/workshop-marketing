Freelancers tend to beat around the bush when it comes to money. 

It's common to ask "what's your hourly rate?" when what you're really interested in knowing is how much a freelancer makes (and particularly how much more/less they make than you). 

An hourly rate can be deceptive. All it gives you is a number. You're left to piece how much they actually make, where they find work, and other important questions alone.

That's one of the reasons I surveyed hundreds of freelancers.

__My survey asked three basic questions:__

1. How much do you make per month?
2. What do you do when you run out of work?
3. How much of your work comes from each source?

		<td class="good">+91%</td>
	</tr>
		
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: left;">Look for work on a job board or marketplace</td>
		<td>15%</td>
		<td>$3,257</td>
		<td>+13%</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: left;">Turn to their social media or network</td>
		<td>40%</td>
		<td>$2,920</td>
		<td>+1%</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: left;">Do nothing or wait</td>
		<td>24%</td>
		<td>$2,316</td>
		<td class="bad">-20%</td>
	</tr>
</table>




### The results were clear: the people who went directly to prospects by emailing them made almost 2X more than everybody else.

Yet, twice as many freelancers do nothing during a dry spell.

So, why do only 12% of people go direct, when it's clear it works?

The truth is it that it takes a lot more work to do outreach and when you're used to billing hundreds of dollars for an hour of your time â€“ spending that much time on something else besides billable work just isn't the best use of your time.

That's why the rest of the course below will walk you through how to make this process 10x faster.
