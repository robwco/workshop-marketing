One of the issues I am having lately is finding leads for projects. It seams all of the leads are looking for an employee, such as these two that came from today's letsworkshop lead email:

http://jobs.coreint.org/397
https://authenticjobs.com/jobs/24811/ios-developer

I haven't been approaching jobs like these because they are looking for employees, and I am just looking for projects. I am concerned that I am leaving money on the table though. Is there a strategy for pitching to companies like these?

All of the workshop exclusive leads seam to be projects and leads a freelancer would go for.

Be a person that others can come to for answers. If you notice a problem, speak up — but also offer 3 potential solutions. You can say, “Hi BOSS, I noticed that we seem to be losing people at X point of the sales process. (SHOW DATA.) I did a little research and noticed that other sites have solved this by using a few different strategies. Here are the 3 best ones. I’d recommend we try B, but what do you think?” In this way, you’re showing the problem, you’re offering solutions, you’re even offering a specific recommendation, but you’re leaving the final decision with your boss. That gets noticed.
