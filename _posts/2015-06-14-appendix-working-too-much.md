A lot of successful freelancers and even consultancies have switched to a new type of business model.

Instead of just showing off past work, these consultants have focused on turning their service offering into a story and using past work only to support that story.

This new type of portfolio improves the clarity of what is being offered and why it’s valuable. Instead of a portfolio, their website’s look more like a store or product page. There’s a clear buy button (or next step) and prominent pricing.

Their portfolio becomes a product that’s for sale for people who want something similar.

They use customized forms, mailing-list auto responders, and systematized documents that cut down hand-holding and focus instead on delivering more value.

They seem to realize that their website will never get a ton of traffic, so they focus instead on catering to the small group of people that actually visit their website. They spend weeks studying their customer and writing copy that will paint a picture of what working together will look like.

They’ve put themselves into their clients shoes and don’t shy away from pricing. They simply charge what they are worth and what they’re comfortable with.

You can start doing this today. Here’s some examples of this approach:

What these all have in common is they're focused on selling outcomes instead of selling hours of their time. So why are all of these approaches working so well?

The easy answer is that they focus on removing potential barriers clients may have.
Not one mentions a portfolio, instead they focus on making you feel like working with them is a no-brainer.

No the work doesn’t speak for itself, so before you can deliver more value to our clients with awesome work you need to GET CLIENTS. Believe it or not that’s a pretty crucial step.

In a nutshell, this approach is about guiding the uninitiated stranger all the way to the life-long dream-client. While this won’t make your work any better, it sure as hell will make your potential client’s think it’s better — and that perception will certainly make more people become paying client’s.
