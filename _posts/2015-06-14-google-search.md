<span class="run-in"><span>G</span>oogle is one of the best ways to find leads</span> but freelancers rarely use it. 

In fact, Google indexes a ton of opportunities that you can find by tweaking a few key search settings. 

For example, if you’re interested in responding to [RFP’s](http://letsworkshop.com/requests-for-proposals), you can search: __“RFP website design development filetype:PDF”__ to only show PDF documents. 

Further, you can set your search range to just the “past week” to only get recent, relevant results. 

There’s no limit to the amount of links you’ll find on google, so getting specific with keywords, budget, search options, and anything else you can is really going to help.

[Here's what a google search with those settings looks like.](https://www.google.com/search?q=RFP+website+design+development+filetype:PDF&num=50&safe=off&es_sm=91&biw=1521&bih=1080&source=lnt&tbs=qdr:w&sa=X&ei=mAUSVZ-hIYjToATr0IDACA&ved=0CBQQpwU)
