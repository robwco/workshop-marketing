So you know you need to build trust with potential clients before you ask for the sale. How can you do that? It seems like a really hard thing to do. To take someone from stranger to trusted confidant...

... All over email?

Well no, you’re not really going to build that relationship over email. It just is going to start over email. We covered how to over deliver on value in the last module. Now we’re going to talk about building trust in this one. Building trust is a bit simpler. 

You build trust by first being honest with yourself. You need to not be afraid to give your honest feedback no matter what. Even if it means losing the client. If you don’t think you can help someone you shouldn’t bring them on. 

If you don’t think they need your services, you shouldn’t bring them on. The same can be said for your work. If you don’t think making a certain change in your work is really the best move than don’t do it. 

Now, pick and choose your battles of course, but really if you’re not absolutely 100% behind a move, it’s your duty to let the client know. After all they’re paying you to give them your expert opinion. That’s the only reason they came to you. Don’t break that trust. 

So how do you take this approach and turn it to potential clients? Apply the same principles. Give your honest take. If that means saying no to a client’s project because you don’t think you can help, so be it. Sure you might lose out on a short-term revenue bump but you’ll also gain a whole lot of trust. 

One trick for this is to draw attention to your flaws. Now this seems counter-intuitive but place yourself in a buyers mind. For example, if you were buying an old chair from a antique mid-century modern dealer, and it was going to cost a pretty penny. Let’s say you noticed a small scratch on the inside of the chair. Would you trust a dealer who called attention to this scratch and made sure you know about it BEFORE you bought it? Or would you trust a dealer who quickly brushed over it and tried to make sure you didn’t see it with the angles he showed you?

That’s the difference between building trust and trying to sell. Take this approach when you talk to potential clients. Make sure what you’re recommending is in their best interest. Never do or sell something just for the money. It has to be about more than that.

A few more ways you can establish trust. Are through showing yourself to your clients. Show your work using case studies. Show what other clients have said with testimonials. Videos and podcasts are really great for building trust because the clients gets to see you and hear you. You always trust people who you know more intimately. Video and audio are a great way to up your level of intimacy quickly. 

Now combine both of these to create something extremely trust building. Can you do a case study about a time you screwed up? If so that’s actually more powerful than a case study where everything went perfectly. 

Can you record yourself talking about something you did wrong early in your career to make sure your prospects don’t make the same mistake?

These sorts of ideas will not only help you estblaihs trust, it will give your clients an idea of your process. It demonstrates problem solving and the ability to make the best even when things go bad or aren’t perfect. That’s what a client really care about. Who can’t be awesome when everything goes perfect. 

A client wants someone who isn’t going to dip out of their project as soon as something goes wrong. That’s what’s going to build trust for them. Future clients need to envision themselves in it.
