How do you handle projects that are outside of your safe zone?
I've backed away from a couple absurdly high-value projects – though likely for a different reason.

When I come across these big projects, I ask myself two questions.

Question 1: Can I do this? 
In my eyes, there are only two answers – yes or no. It's pretty cut and dry when it comes down to capabilities. We all know our own skillset, and the capabilities of those we have at our disposal when applicable.

Question 2: Can I afford to f*ck this up?
This is the kicker. This potential client – a BIG client with BIG contacts and a BIG reputation – is looking for a solution to a problem. I don't like to fail, and the last thing I want to do is give them another problem. If I wad this project up, what is the blowback? Is my reputation shot in an entire industry? And, most importantly, can I afford the financial liability, or the possibility of not getting paid?

Of course I would stress, never be afraid to fail – but don't put yourself in the position of having to close your business because of only one failure.

After a few years I made a rule. I'd never take on a project that was more than 20% bigger than any previous work I'd done. That meant saying NO to what appeared to be exciting opportunities but it meant that growth was sustainable and stretched things like cash flow, reporting, resources and client communications instead of tearing them.
