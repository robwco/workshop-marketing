Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I've sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn't be possible.

Some examples of automation include: [Workshop's long form sales page](http://letsworkshop.com) which does a great job of anticipating and answering most questions. It also lets you sign up for a free course that drips more information into your inbox. Plus, I have a [new FAQ](http://letsworkshop.com/advice) that answers Workshop + other related questions. 

But still some people prefer to talk to a real person. They rather open up their email and fire over a quick question. I get that. Instead of trying to stop these tire-kickers, I decided to use a years worth of knowledge to answer their questions in a way that felt like I was writing to them but was 100% automated.

In practice this meant someone could send me their question, and get an automated answer back from me. Sort of like a create your own adventure book. I was able to do this with [automation feature in Drip](http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555), using ideas from Patrick McKenzie's recent email: [Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation). 

Implementing this system has been one of the biggest wins for me (and my inbox) this year. Here's what the process looks like:

**When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:**

*Subject: how was the demo?*
![Workshop's Course Welcome Email](http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-welcome.png)

I've used this email before (without the links at the end) and it always got a high reply rate. But now even people who don't have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. This is also where a years-worth of (at times brain-numbing) customer service paid off.  I came up with these 4 options because I knew it always came down to those 4. Note: I don't keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback, it simply triggers a follow-up email.

**Clicking on one of the options triggers a one-off email that addresses their feedback:**

*Subject: RE: how was the demo?*
![Workshop's Course Follow-up Email](http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-followup.png)

I've gotten a huge response rate to this email, because it feels so real – mostly because IT IS REAL. It's exactly what I would say to one of those objections. It's me.

I've setup my site to be really focused on lead-gen and opt-ins from leads. I've even replaced my homepage with a (shortish) long form sales letter. My autoresponder course is pretty basic, it mostly covers what a potential client can expect working with me. Pretty much any freelancer or consultant could do the same. Topics:

1. What to expect
2. The story of Little Stream Software
1. The ideal client
1. Project management and managing chaos
1. What to expect before starting a project
1. More than just code
1. The end and a beginning...

Then I'll send out broadcasts when I have availability or a new guide (guides are one of my main incentives for opt-ins). It's worked pretty good so far but I'm going to replace it all with more focused content. I recently re-focused my niche so this version is very generic.

Even starting with a short 3-day series could be valuable: "Hi I'm X", "How I can help you", "Can we talk?"

You know, a mailing list doesn't have to feel like a mailing list. For example you might not need anything besides gmail and streak. Having a small group of people that you keep in contact with about common interests can be enough to create a small pool potential clients (and friends) that you interact with weekly, or monthly. Check out this email that my accountant friend sent me today:

> "Hi Rob,
Check this out. A startup is selling a $10 roll of quarters for $15. Sounds insane, but I can totally see a ton of people doing it. Sometimes it’s the simple problems lol
http://washboard.co
Have a great day!"

There's no pitch, but it makes me keep him top of mind.
