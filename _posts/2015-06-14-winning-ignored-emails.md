Here's an email I picked up from Blair Enns. It's revived cold leads, dead deals, and gotten responses to ignored emails.

It's simple:

> "I haven't heard back from you on [project/opportunity] so I'm going to assume you've gone in a different direction or your priorities have changed."

I use it pretty regularly. it works because it makes it clear to the recipient that you've moved on. Since people are loss averse, their natural inclination is to say "Wait!" and open the deal.

Try it out. I'm sure you have sales leads you haven't heard back from. Email them this and see what they say. You have nothing to lose
