Have you ever not known what to call something? 

I always thought naming something was the hardest thing about of web design but recently I realized something. It's **most** of what designing for the web is. The stuff you build gets built *because* you to know what to say / write. This applies to stuff like:

- Writing website copy
- Sending emails
- Designing graphics
- Coding sites and apps
- Writing books
- Naming products

What separates the bad from the great isn't great graphics or an intuitive UI. That stuff helps but what matters is what's written. That informs everything. 

It all comes back to the content and knowing what to say.

Why? Because design is about words. Most of what we do is about shaping words. That's the biggest element on the web. Most online businesses seem to forget and/or ignore it.
