Baremetrics

Hey Josh,
I saw your open position this morning and had a sneaky suspicion you had probably read my resume while building out the wish list. So rather then hold you in suspense I’ll just come out and say the wait is over. I am your man.

I lead a small two man creative studio here in Lexington, Kentucky. Personally I specialize in human interactions, creative direction and the lion’s share of construction. I spent around 3 months awhile back working with Ruby but wound up dropping it out of the workflow in favor of Javascript frameworks like Angular, Meteor, Ionic and Famo.us. I’ve also worked extensively with the Javascript build systems Grunt and Gulp. So I've got experience and knowledge in Ruby + Rails & Sinatra but a heck of a lot more in advanced Javascript.

Let's not stop there though, I've actually built some pretty incredible Javascript plugins myself for my favorite CMS Statamic.

Yak. Amazon S3 Powered Blogging.
Elixir. Responsive image add-on.
Chameleon. Responsively generate all the things.
Then there are Ionic iOS apps which are powered entirely by Javascript. Here's an open source project you can take a look at but I've also built apps with Ionic for Wrangler Network and the US Navy.

Let's also cover some other web related technologies. I write all my own HTML and CSS and of course use Sass but I've also built projects using Jade, Stylus & CoffeeScript.

Last but not least I'm well versed in Stripe and it's implementation from the basic Checkout to very custom & fully featured implementations.

So yeah, I think I am more then your perfect fit for this position. I relish solving problems and I love the work. Stripe is a passion and it would be a tremendous pleasure to merge all of this together into an exiting product with such an admirable team as Baremetrics.
