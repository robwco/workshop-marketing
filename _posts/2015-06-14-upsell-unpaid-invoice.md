I've been lucky in that I've only had this happen to me twice. Both times, I ended the relationship with the client. Both times I got paid. I didn't negotiate, and I didn't reason, as those both tell the client they intimidate me. Don't be intimidated! Be firm. You're not looking for future work with this client, so you have nothing to gain by doing them any favors. At this point, this is just a matter of collecting from a deadbeat.

How do you make sure you get paid on time as a freelancer?

To make sure hosting bills aren't ignored, I include this note: "Overdue Balances: Your hosting account will be suspended for an overdue balance when payment has not been received in the allotted time frame. If the overdue balance is not paid within 30 days of the suspension, then your account will be closed and all data deleted."

For our monthly billing in arrears, we moved from Net 30 to Net 10 and send overdue notices immediately after the 10 days and again each week thereafter. In practice this means we get around 80% of payments within 2 weeks and very rarely get anything after 30 days. That's definitely more effective than our old process of Net 30 with reminder notices after 15 days and 25 days with overdue notices after 30.

We also increasingly do an SOW with flat rate pricing for projects for existing clients for anything over ~$750, and pre-bill it. We offer them the option of paying a 60-70% deposit before we start the work, with the balance due at completion; or they can pay 100% up front and get a ~5% discount on the project. We actually figure out the 100% payment price based on the work and add on top of it to get to the two-payment fee amount, though, so it's effectively a surcharge on the two payment option, we just phrase it as a discount for paying up front. We haven't had a client choose the two payment option since we started doing this around 5 months ago.

btw, some of the larger corporate clients we work with insist on Net 30, mostly because their AP departments can't turn around payments faster anyway, so we follow our old strategy of reminder notices. But clients like that usually pay on time anyway, since it's a very mechanical process for them - they're paying hundreds or thousands of invoices. We usually take a deposit when we start working with clients like that, so we have some padding to work against.

...and one more thing :)
we send invoices for hosting 3 months before their renewal is up, and again each month if they haven't paid. then follow the usual reminder/overdue process.

I do a few things:

1. I invoice every week. I know some people that invoice once a month. If you do this, you could potentially go 60 days without payment. That is a huge risk. Invoice once a week and your risk is lowered to 30 - 45 days.

1. I immediately stop work if the invoice is not paid on time and I spell that out in contracts and give them a notice via email.

1. I have a 10% late fee

1. I have a 5% reduction if they pay with 15 days. A lot of clients take advantage of this, some have abused it by paying 21 days etc. If they do that, then I take it away from them.

We include the payment terms in contracts and also in invoices.
Here is the line we use: "Please note that invoices not paid according to terms are subject to a 10% monthly service charge." If the client doesn't pay us on time, we send a friendly reminder about the 10% monthly service charge. In most cases we are getting payed within a week after the reminder. We billed "late payment fee" only once, when the client was constantly late with payments and we already new that we wanted to fire this client.

I have yet to implement, but I've seen others have success with a "discount" if paid within 15 days, as Jamie Wright mentioned. I think that a 5% reduction is a bit generous however. For instance, my family's book binding business has seen payments come in a bit quicker with a 1.5% discount at 15 days or less.

I have found that including a nice little segment in my contracts about being a small business and the difficulties associated with it has helped keep things moving a bit... Here's the snippet:

"We are sure you understand how important it is for us, as a small business, that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. To make things easy, our payment schedule is comprised of two simple parts (insert your payment schedule here)."
