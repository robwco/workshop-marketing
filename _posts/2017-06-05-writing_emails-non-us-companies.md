How do you improve your chances as a firm outside the US looking to land clients? Here's my tips for you on the way that I would approach companies in the US as an outside firm.

I’m going to give you some very straight forward advice - others would sugar coat it but I’m not going to - I’m just going to tell you with no BS what you’re doing wrong. 

First, here’s a few quick things that I would change:

- Never use “Greetings” just say “Hello” or use their first name. “Greetings” sounds like an alien bot and people will immediate think you are spam.

- I would shorten your name in gmail to just use Vlad Federov. Vlad is more common here and so western clients will be more familiar with it and more comfortable with you. Look, I know this is not fair or right, but it will probably get you better results.

- You don’t want to say you do it all. This comes off extremely unprofessional. Instead you want to be world-class at one hyper-focused thing. In this scenario they’re looking for someone great at publishing and marketing. you need to focus your email on this specific need of theirs.

- Don’t include quotes, unless they’re from the head of very well known companies - they won’t get read anyway.

- I’ve never heard the expression “no underwater rocks”. I don’t think this is common. 
Your email is too long. You are coming off pushy, and like you are rushing to the sale when you have not established a need yet. 


1. Name
When you send off an email the recipient is only going to have 2 ways to get information about you to decide if htey shoudl open the meail. Your subject line and your name. My recommendation is to make your name something that is recognizable. This might seem weird so if you re uncomfortable with it i understand, but I'm just here to give you tips that will help improve your response and open rate. So, for example, you could go by Mat Ross. A common nickname here in the US is Mat so people are used to seeing that name. That's a name that wouldn't raise suspicision on my end of anythign and you jsut seem normal.

2. Don't bring up that you're a foreign company pre-maturely
Think of this like dating. When you're courting someone you don't bring up your faults (or something that you're not sure they will perceive as a fault) atleast not until you've established a connection. You want to put your best foot forward, you don't want to lie or keep the information frmo them especially if they ask. But you also don't want to bring it up in the first email when there is no need. (That said, of course you want to tell them at some point. My recommendation is you do this on a call.)

3. Use the phrase "with past clients..."
If a client brings up the fact that you're outside of the country as a concenr, one of the best ways to ease their concern is to use the phrase "with past clients in your timezone,  we found that being available and leaving an overlap of 3 hours every workday was actually more than enough. In fact, in a lot of ways it was actually better for them because they got to wake up to fresh work and it let them be more productive."

4. Make english a priority
If you send me your emails I can almost gaurantee that I will be able to find some errors in your grammar. Its simply difficult to write perfect American english unless you're completely native to the US.It's also an easy way for companies to rationalize not responding to your email. Your english needs to be spotless at the beginning of the courtin gprocess. A lot of startups and firms in the us willl be able to spot weird colloquiialisms that don't trasnalte from a mile away. This is one of the most common errors i asee frmo non-us based companies when pitching. You need to make sure there are not only no errors in grammmar but also no wierd phrases and other things. That make you seem out of place in thier inbox . I consider hiring someone to read this. And send emails on your behald. Bonuse points inf they're in the usa. 

5. Don't pitch yourself as a cheaper option
Even if you are infact cheaper you don't want to sell pbased on a lower price. Instead you want to offer more better services. That is more incentivizing to people to know they can get more done than they can dsave a few bvucks. This will attract bad clients who just want the lowest price anyway. Not the type of clients you'er looking for. This also comes off as kind of scammy on your end like you're desperate and you'll say anything you need to make the sale.


The question is: how do you improve your chances as an outside firm looking to land clients inside the US? 

Here’s how I would do that:

(Note: I’m going to give you some very straight forward advice - I’m not going to sugar coat anything as I wouldn’t want someone to BS me either. I would just want someone to give it to me straight. All advice is solely with your success in mind, you don’t need to heed all of it.)

DO think about your name - 
When someone receives an email from you there are only 2 bits of information to help them decide to open the email. One is your subject line, the other is your name. My recommendation is to use the native version of your name possible. This isn’t always possible, but to give you a couple examples, if your name is Vladislav I’d use Vlad. If your name is Mateo I’d use Matt. This might seem weird and it’s totally ok to not be comfortable with this approach, but I honestly think it would help improve your response / open rate. If people are used to seeing your name and comfortable with it, it’s one less thing they can discount you on. This isn’t about deceiving but instead putting your best foot forward. 

DO make English a priority
The fact is almost everyone makes errors in their emails. I do, you do. We all do. However, because you’re outside the US, your grammar is put under a microscope. A client who knows you’re from outside the US will worry about communication issues more than with a local company. It’s unfair but it’s the truth. You can ignore this fact, or you can prepare for it. Your english needs to be almost perfect at the beginning of the courting process. Make sure all of your emails make sense or a startup will be able to spot the weirdness from a mile away. This is one of the most common errors I see from non-us companies when pitching - and I know for a fact that it kills your response rate. You don’t want to use weird phrases that seem out of place. I would consider hiring someone to write/read the emails that is in the United States.

Example of a english mistake commonly made among non-US companies:
Using the salutation “Greetings” to start your email. Never use this phrase. Instead just say “Hello” or use their first name. “Greetings” sounds like an alien bot and people will immediate think you are spam. However, I’ve seen many foreign companies start their emails this way. 

DON’T bring up that you're a foreign company pre-maturely - 
This is another thing I see companies doing that shoots themselves in the foot. Think of it like dating. When you're courting someone you don't bring up your faults or things that can be perceived as a fault prematurely, instead you wait until you’ve established a connection and reveal more of yourself with team. Don’t get me wrong, you don’t want to hide the fact that you’re a foreign company  (that’s impossible anyway) but you also don’t want to create a roadblock by mentioning it for no reason. Again, you want to put your best foot forward, so my recommendation is the best time to let them know you’re outside the US is during your first call.

DO use the phrase "with past clients in your timezone..."
If a client says that your company being outside the US is a concern, one of the best ways I’ve seen to ease this is to use past US clients as an example of the arrangement working well. For example instead of saying something like “don’t worry we can take care of your needs” you can say something like: "with past clients in your timezone, we found that giving a 3 hour overlap on weekdays was more than enough. In fact, in some ways it was actually better for them because they got to wake up to fresh work, something that let them be more productive and wouldn’t have been possible with a US based company.” Look for ways to pitch your uniqueness as an advantage. 

DON'T pitch yourself as a cheaper option
Even if you are infact cheaper you don't want your only selling point to be a lower price. This will make the client value you less. Instead of talking about your cheaper price, talk about more better services you offer. That is more intriguing to the type of clients you want. Instead of attracting bad clients who just want the lowest price, this will attract clients looking to get a lot done. Touting a lower price also comes off as kind of scammy on your end and can give a smell of desperation.

DON’T say you do it all.
Another common one among foreign companies. This comes off unprofessional. Instead of being able to handle everything, you want to be world-class at one hyper-focused thing.Focus your email on the specific need of theirs.
