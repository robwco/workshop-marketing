Probably the least appealing part about using outreach to find clients is the idea that you’ll be chasing work from clients. Think about it, if you contact clients you’re instantly put in the lower position. It’s you who needs something from them. (And that’s very true). But there is a way to change that dynamic. 

Outreach should be about delivering value, establishing trust, and alerting qualified prospects about a possible fit. That’s it. Selling should be left for later. You can’t win a client in your outreach campaign. That has to happen at a later point. Why? Because of timing. Timing plays the biggest role of any in winning clients.  We’ll spend a whole lesson on Timing coming up. 

But while you’re delivering value, establishing trust, and alerting qualified prospects about the potential of a great fit. You need to nudging them. Let me explain. As you first contact someone, there are indirect ways you can point them to you as a the obvious choice for their project. 

- You can use your email signature to point prospects to an email course or your project inquiry form. 
- You can link to resources like guides or plugins you’ve created for clients in similar situations to them. 
- You can send them parts of blog posts you’ve written. 
- And yes, you can and should send them a note mentioning you’re perfect for their project. 

The key is once they know about you, once you’ve established the trust, and your value. Once you have mentioned you’re interested in taking on their project. This is where it’s time to back off. I don’t mean by not following up. THE OPPOSITE. Continue to follow up. Just don’t try advancing the conversation without ONE thing happening first. 

The prospect client HAS to establish that they want YOU to work on their project. Before they do that you’re not allowed to try “closing the sale” you’re not even allowed to put them on your calendar. This is how you go from using outreach to sell clients, to using outreach to create inbound leads. 

You’re using outreach to attract instead of chase. Make every single lead hit a wall. That wall in your project inquiry form. To advance beyond the wall they simply MUST submit that form. They need to take the time to answer questions you need about their project. They need to take the time. They need to INVEST something into working with you BEFORE you can start discussing the project. 

Notice again I said they need to INVEST something into you and your project. 

You’ve done the same. You’ve delivered them value. You’ve found a useful piece of advice for them or delivered some wisdom to them. Use the rule of reciprocity to make your outreach more effective. By delivering value to them not only are you establishing trust, you’re making them be in debt to you. They’re going to want to at least interview you for the project. At least let you bid on the project. However, you’ll quickly let them know that this isn’t possible without a few things from them. 

Making clients invest in working with you will not only make it more likely they actually choose you for the project, it will make them happier throughout the project. You’ll have a list of answers - in their own words that talk about exactly what they need from the project. You’ll be able to tune your messaging to the same frequency they use. 

Best of all you become the one who’s sought after. The power dynamic of the relationship changes. You’re no longer chasing them for work. You’ve given them value. You’ve given them resources. You’ve established trust. Now it’s their turn. Now you’re the one on top and they’re coming to you for something they want. 

Your time. A chance to be on your schedule. You’ve made it so that everything has to happen on your terms. The person who has to do the work to make this happen changes accordingly. 

If at this point they stop replying or you don’t fill out your project inquiry form, it means you haven’t delivered enough value, or established enough trust. Continue to follow up with them until you get a no. 

Continue to brainstorm ideas for how you can help (use the list of ideas we covered in lesson X). If they go cold it likely means their busy. Use your regular follow up sequence covered in module X. 

Another idea is to offer a small part of your time, like a free consult or a couple ideas for how you can help. Dangle this carrot in front of them by saying you can deliver this only after they fill out your project inquiry form. It’s very likely you’ll have to do a call with them anyway at some point before the project, so it makes sense for you to use this as an incentive. There’s literally no limit to the amount of things you could use as an incentive to create incentive for them to fill out this project inquiry form. 

The key here is to create enough desire in them … NOT to close the sale. That’s not what the goal is. It’s for them to want to have you in on the process. It’s for the to look at you as a trusted resource they can come back to. Again it’s not trying to close the sale completely. 

That’s for later in the process.

•	The outreach email campaign that will qualify leads 
⁃	You’ll want to contact at least 15 leads each month. 
⁃	This sounds pretty easy but there’s some high-level psychology involved if you want to do it effectively
⁃	You don’t want to ask for something off the bat (like a phone call)
⁃	You don’t want to rush the process
⁃	You don’t want to make the conversation about you or what you’ll get from it
⁃	Instead you want to make the email about the person you’re emailing
⁃	Ideally you’d like to deliver something of value with this email
⁃	Let’s take a look at a real life situation so we can break down the process:


•	Taking your cold outreach email from GOOD to GREAT
⁃	Now the email we wrote in the last module is pretty good
⁃	It’s already better than 90% of what people will send. 
⁃	However, it’s not perfect, heres how we take it to the next level
⁃	Use a tool like Quickmail which automates followups and makes sure you follow up with 100% of leads
⁃	I can’t stress this enough if you only take one thing from this course it’s that following up with cold emails will 4x your response rate BY ITSELF


•	Pouring leads into this cold outreach campaign
⁃	Once you have your cold email outreach campaign in place optimized and ready you don’t want to do the process of finding leads to pour in yourself. Atleast not forever.
⁃	I’m going to share with you the exact scripts I use with my VA’s to find leads.
⁃	This is years of training and seeing exactly what works for you
⁃	In the bonus for this module you’ll see my process document and a video tutorial for training a lead-finding VA
⁃	Places you can tell a VA to find you leads to drop in to your campaign:
⁃	Job Boards
⁃	Local Clients
⁃	Inc 5000
⁃	Yellow pages
⁃	Linkedin (check out Leadfuze)
⁃	Hiring someone to do this costs 300-600 a MONTH
⁃	The value of knowing that you have an outreach email going out that’s super effective is worth twice that price alone
⁃	I also offer a done for you service where I deliver 12-15 different types of frealcner and agency leads to you each weekday for $199 a month
⁃


•	The second step outreach email that will push people to your contact form
⁃	So once this email starts generating replies it’s time to put them on a new campaign
⁃	I recommend that this campaign still be automated but push people to your contact form. 
⁃	We’ll talk about your contact form next, and what happens after that in future modules. schedule calls for you 
⁃	Once you have leads that are responding to your contact form questionnaire
⁃	You want to tell them:
⁃	Sounds great! 
⁃	Deliver even more value
⁃	Push them to fill out the contact form on your website, only this time call it a discovery form
