So you fire off that email to the client with a crisp new version of their project and wait. A few days later they respond but when you read the email you start to feel sick.

Staring back at you is 20 bullet-points outlining what *“needs to be changed”*. There's no mention of the problems they're attempting to solve, just prescribed solutions – a list of instructions.

### Don’t blame the client, it’s your job to teach them.

No one knows how to give good feedback instinctively. Even designers have a hard time giving feedback to each other, so a client has no chance. They don’t care about your work, they care about their business. So make every bit of feedback focus on that. Educate your client with my <a href="/downloads/feedback.pdf">feedback template</a>.

### Here's how you get perfect feedback every time:
You and your client want the same thing: a successful project. Now, imagine if you didn't have to fight through bad feedback to get there. You could send off comps without crossing your fingers and praying. Better yet, what if it took minimal effort, because you had a system for getting meaningful feedback on even the most complex projects?

Sound hard? Maybe it's becuase <em>you</em> don't even know what perfect feedback looks like. I had the same problem. That’s why I created a special document for my clients that did the job of educating them on what effective feedback looks like. I now send it with every project, and know I'll get damn good feedback every time.

	Or if you prefer, you can send <a href="/downloads/feedback.pdf">this PDF</a>. Attach it to every new project and comp as a routine reminder about how to discuss your work.
