When paying a freelancer costs less than the alternative (ie. doing it alone), hiring a freelancer is a good investment. But for a business, they can't know if that's the case until cost is established. 

That's why hiring a freelancer is a weird proposition. A business typically knows their domain well. Hiring a freelancer isn't part of that domain.

When a business uses a job board to find a freelancer, they're met with a blank form saying "fill this out". That's tough to do when you don't know what you need. That's why most businesses reach out to their network to refer them a freelancer.

Still, they eventually get asked "what do you want?" 

As someone who's hired a handful of freelancers in the past year, I no longer look to buy freelancing this way. I now look to buy it they way people have been buying stuff for thousands of years.

I look to buy products.  

Why? Because I understand how products are priced. I get to see what's being purchased.

I bought [Draft Revise Express](https://draft.nu/revise/express/) this way and the thing I loved about it was I was able to see exactly what I was getting *before* I decided to purchase. It felt logical.

It made it easier to say 'yes this is the right investment' because I was no longer being forced to pay for a black box of value. Instead of hiring a freelancer that says "I'll make all of your wildest dreams come true." I hired a product that said, "I'm this."

Sure, another freelancer might be able to do more for me than this product for less money, but how the fuck would I know that. It's 2015 and it's simply not worth the time it takes for me to figure that out.

My business isn't about paying freelancers in hopes that they might help me some day. It's about making me money. It's about mitigating risk in investments that will make me more money. Just like every other company. 

Your consultancy business too. For examples, you don't do spec work. It's not in your best interest to do work that may or may not end up in getting paid. So why should a client hire a freelancer without a firm guarantee of what they're getting. How is that fair?

You might be thinking, "Well proposing a solution takes time from the freelancer and they're not getting anything for it. Proposing a solution is basically spec work." This is true. 

Freelancers shouldn't do this either. Instead there's another way of selling things that's been used for thousands of years: creating a product. 

Better yet, in the past year productized services have been sweeping the web. The freelancer gives the business information it needs to make a sound investment and buy the freelance service: namely a price, a set scope of work, and an outcome. 

The freelancer gets to propose this without having to create it from scratch for every client. The freelancer gets to decide what the terms of the service are.

I truly prefer working this way. 

In fact, when I needed help on a specific project recently, I actively seeked out a productized service. That's how I found [Drip Concierge](http://dripconcierge.com/) by Philip Morgan.

The only problem was finding it  was tough. I know I'm a lot better connected with freelancers than the average business so I decided to make something.

I created [Wheelhouse](http://inwheelhouse.com), a directory of the best productized services in one place that businesses can refer back to if they ever need help on a project. 

I'll let you know how you can have your productized service featured on the site very soon.
