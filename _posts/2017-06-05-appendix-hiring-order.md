> Hire copy first, design second, code third

Words are design. If you’re hiring someone to design your site, they should start with words. If they don’t or they can’t than you should hire someone else. If you have a designer already but they don’t know how to write copy you may want to reconsider that designer. Until then, hire a copywriter. Make every design go through the copywriter before it gets to the designer. Likewise, your website, your app, or your software should all go through the designer before it gets to the developer. You can’t develop something soundly without sound design in place first. Development is also design. It’s all design really.
