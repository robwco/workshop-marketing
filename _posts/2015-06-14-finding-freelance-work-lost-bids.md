<span class="run-in"><span>Y</span>ou have nothing to lose</span> by asking a client why they didn't hire you, since by definition you've already lost the project.

However, you'll make yourself crazy if you try to fix all of the problems with your conduct that the client tells you. You will be told you were too quick to reply, too slow, too pushy, and not attentive enough.

Ultimately, you're not going to be the right fit for everyone and that's okay.
