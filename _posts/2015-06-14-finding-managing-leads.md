I'm currently using gmail for pretty much everything. I did consider creating a spreadsheet as well to manage leads, but then thought, do I really need to?

How I actually do it, is by using the following tools;Pen and a small notebook. (List of potential clients, list of current clients). If a lead is unsuccessful, I simply cross it off. And I do this every 1 maybe 2 weeks. 2. I also label my leads in gmail, which I think is a good simple system to use.

I wouldn't consider an actual web app or anything else to manage leads as majority of it is through email anyway. As well as that, personally, I've been trying to keep my list quite even, between current and potential clients. I don't want to take too much on, I don't apply to leads on a daily basis, or any at all if i've got 3 clients on. I only accept / apply for big budget work so my list of 'currents' are always between 1 and 4. I'd have no time for more so I wouldn't be able to apply to them.

What I do have though is a spreadsheet for clients that pay for ongoing services. Other than that, email labels all the way man! :)
