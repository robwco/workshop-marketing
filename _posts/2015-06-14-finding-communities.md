Consulting can feel like you're in a room alone on a treadmill. There's never an end to the work. You're alone. The worst part is there's almost nothing that can fix this except for experience. 

That's why my favorite thing to come out of Workshop has been the community it created. It's brought people together that have been in your shoes before. They know what it's like to deal with the problems you have. 

In fact, you can take almost any question to them and get a great answer. 

Rookies that have never landed a project before are welcome to rub shoulders with world-class consultancy owners. We all ask questions, get advice, and help each other. 

This experience is easily more valuable than anything I could've ever produced alone. The only problem was, you had to be a member to experience it. In fact, even new members looked at the hundreds of discussions in our community and felt overwhelmed.

After all, there's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of advice hidden in it, but finding it all was tough. 

**Not anymore.**

I went through it all myself. Hundreds of threads. Over a year's worth of questions, answers, resources, tips, and tricks left by some of the best consultants in the world. I sorted out the recurring questions, I found the best answers, and I put it all together for you on one page.

This is one of the most valuable things I've ever created. However, I didn't create it alone. Almost every Workshop member had a part in it. So it felt right to make it available for everyone at no cost.

You'll find some of freelancing's biggest questions answered by all different types of freelancers. Even better, it's all sorted and organized for you to not only find what you're looking for, but also so that you can come back and refer to it time after time.

Lastly, I spent thousands of dollars of my own money making this available for free. I don't ask this often, but to continue creating stuff like this, it would mean the world if you'd share this page with anyone you think would benefit. I hope to keep adding to it and making it one of the most valuable pages for freelancers on the internet.
