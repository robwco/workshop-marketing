Every time you deliver new work to a client it's an opportunity to upsell them on something new. 

I use Miekd's Delivery. https://github.com/miekd/delivery

Delivery is a micro web-app that allows you to quickly show static previews of your web-design work to your clients in the browser, just by simply uploading a few files to your web server.

I get higher approval rates on designs when viewed in browser because its easier for the client to conceptualize it.

I typically use http://prevue.it - it's free and easy for you and clients to leave feedback on a design.

I simply host client files at http://clients.namanyayg.com. My deliverables are all HTML/CSS, though.

I also use http://www.invisionapp.com/ for click-through prototypes. This helps to test website's or app's flow without coding anything. Also there is a great feature that allow to comment on different design elements right on top of mock-ups.
