I recommend this website to designers for the same reason I recommend it to startups, results.

You want to find the right designer, not just a whole bunch of average ones. In fact, the last thing you want is to waste time sorting through applications, portfolios, and intros from people who simply can’t help you.

That’s why it’s great that the community of designers on Folyo is small, compared to some other freelance designer communities. Experienced designer and founder Sacha Greif hand picks each designer with a vigorous portfolio review process. This guarantees that who ever applies to your project is going to be an awesome designer.

Next, the fear and uncertainty of the actual job post creation process is simplified because Folyo actually helps you craft the perfect job posting. Finally, when it comes time to review the applications, say goodbye to reading dozens of detailed email. On Folyo, a designers introduction is limited to 140 characters, which makes the interaction with them loose and honest.

There are hundreds of design communities designed to help you hire and discover designers, check out their work, and get proposals.

Which of these provide the most results for the smallest amount of time and energy?

On Folyo you will only receive 20 to 30 responses for your post, but it’s garaunteed to be the RIGHT 20 designers that reply. So, why sit around sifting through dozens of long emails from designers who aren’t the right ones? Is getting more replies to your project worth a lower quality of designer?
The $100 posting fee is less then 1/10th the cost of hiring the wrong designer.
