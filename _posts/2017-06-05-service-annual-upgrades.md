This is an email I used to create a huge spike in revenue. I want to use it in the future to create an evergreen annual upgrade email. Think about how you can use something like this with your clients to create a hard-to-resist offer.

> I hope you’re doing well. I’m emailing you because there’s a couple urgent matters I gotta touch base with you on. not everyone is getting this email.
> 
> First off did you know you’re about to lose out on $689?
> 
> The current pricing for Workshop is $99/month and it’s about to go up in price again as I release some big improvements and additional features to Workshop.
> 
> Right now you can upgrade to yearly billing for $499 but I won't be offering this price once the new features kick in. That means you can lock-in your Workshop subscription at this $41/month introductory price forever right now. 
> 
> I don’t normally send an email like this if you're on monthly billing but because of the coming improvements to Workshop i need to let you know what you’ll be missing out on so you can make a truly informed decision about whether you should commit to Workshop for a year.
>
> That’s also why what’s coming is so exciting to me it’s all designed to land you more work and end dry spells - and it’s about to be released very soon (in June/July)- you’ll be able to:
> 
> 1. Turn off categories that you’re not interested in so you don’t waste even a second.
>
> 2. Track your progress by making sure you’re hitting milestones like emailing leads, getting replies, and winning clients.
>
> 3. Have your own personal email specialist (Julie) find leads that match your specialty, and help you land them by writing emails for you and keeping you accountable.
>
> 4. Use Workshop to land referral work by sending leads to your friends in one-click.
>
> 5. Automated follow up reminders when you have a warm lead to make sure you never forget to follow up.
>
> 6. Access to twice as many premium leads now that I run Folyo.
>
> All of this stuff will be released in the next 2 weeks and all of this is going to make it easier for you to find work.
>
> Like i said already the new features will also come with an increase in price and a cap on the amount of members we take in. 
>
> That’s why this is sorta urgent.
