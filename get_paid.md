title: Getting screwed on freelance projects? (Free $99 offer)
permalink: /get-paid/

# Dear clients,

## You have to live with the results of a project long after a freelancer moves on to the next one.

But you don't know what the results will be before you start. 

That's the thing about being a client. You go into most projects without knowing crucial things like how much the entire thing will cost or how long it will end up taking. 

Usually you don’t even know whether the project will be a net-win for your bottom line.

Those are huge leaps of faith.

To top this off, clients typically don’t know a lick about design or development projects in general.

Most designers and developers don’t even agree on what should be done. With the odds stacked against you, how do you even stand a chance?

## If you have a freelance project coming up, I'd like to help. *(Note: I don’t want to take the project on.)*

However, I would like to speak with you for 15 minutes and give you a unbiased look at what you should expect.

Joining me on the call is agency owner Kurt Elster. Together we have over a million dollars worth of consulting projects under our belts.

As a result of that experience, we have a much better idea of what you should expect than you do. Since both of us are not looking for freelance work this lets us be both candid and honest with you about what your project will look like. 

Whether your budget is too big or too small. What the chances are you’re going to get screwed. What you can do to ensure you don’t get screwed. (Think of it as a road-mapping session to ensure your success.)

Best of all, Workshop and Folyo have some of the best freelancers in the world. 

## For allowing us to help you on the show, you'll get free access to post your project on either Folyo or Workshop (usually $99 posting fee).

For this to work, you have to meet a few criteria:

- Your project has to be real.
- You can’t hold back on questions we ask. 
- You have to be looking to hire a freelancer.
- You have to be available to do the call Tues, Wed, or Thursday morning. 
- You have to supply an email address that we’ll give at the end of the show for people interested in contacting you about the project.

Here’s what’s in it for you:

- You’ll learn a ton about your project, and get a free consult from top-consultants who charge hundreds of dollars per hour. 
- Your business will get nice promotion to an audience of freelancers.
- Your project will get a free listing on Workshop and Folyo. A $99 value.
