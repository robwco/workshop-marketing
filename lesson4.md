So far in this series we've talked about changing your lead-gen strategy, shifting your mindset, and using AngelList to get startup clients.

Next, I'm going to show you how to take it to the next level and find thousands of high-value gigs. Best of all it's going to happen in one place, so you can do it in a few minutes each morning.

Sound too good to be true? 

I get it. But make no mistake, we're about to put a large stake in the heart of the feast or famine fear. Forever. 

Ready?

Me too. But before we jump, let me give you some street cred: for the past 4 years my day job has been looking at hundreds of websites, job boards, and search engines to find quality project-based gigs.

My customers (UX / frontend design firms) have made millions of dollars from the gigs I've found. So I'm uniquely positioned to answer a common question you've probably asked:

**What's the best job board for client work?**

The answer is simple: the best job board for project work is ALL the job boards.

See the truth is great projects get posted in different places every day. So no matter what, one site won't be a complete picture.

It's up to you to figure out where to spend your time. Luckily, I have a head-start for you.

The download below will help you skip YEARS of trial and error setting up a system that creates a recurring stream of clients. Smart. :ok_hand:

The truth is it’s a numbers game. It takes about 30 interesting projects to find and land ONE high-paying gig. (I've done the math.)

You can find that yourself BUT you can't track every job board by hand. You're way too busy for that. You'll get frustrated by how long it takes and give up. I've seen it happen.

**Instead you will want to use an RSS reader.** 

[My personal favorite is Feedbin](http://feedbin.com)

It is awesome. It puts every job site in one place and has a ton of other features that will make your life easier. I’ve tried half a dozen RSS readers over the years and nothing else comes close. 

I can't tell you how much time I've saved because of this app. So I strongly recommend Feedbin for this process. I give it an A+.

**Download my endless client generator**

Most job boards have an RSS link that you can use to monitor jobs posted on their site. 

For an even greater head-start, I'm going to give you my exact list of hundreds of sites that I monitor and have found great projects on.

I call it my Endless Client Generator. You can load it into your own Feedbin account after [downloading it here](/letters/).

To upload it into Feedbin, you'll want to go to: Import & Export and select it.

Once you have all of these job sites loaded into Feedbin, the magic can begin.

You can start searching hundreds of websites for clients in need of your specialty. Here's what it looks like:

<img src="/images/page-elements/feedbin-app.png" class="w-full my-4">

The great thing about this is that all of the people you come across will need someone like you. This means that instead of hitting up someone cold, you're talking to warm prospects already in the buying phase.

To start, use key words like ‘freelancing’, ‘contract work’, ‘remote’, and ‘anywhere’ in your search. This will help you find clients who are already comfortable with project-based work.

Note: you can also pitch full-time opportunities too. I wouldn't be discouraged by job post requirements. There's been countless times where I've emailed someone looking for full-time and won a project.

**Pro-tip: command click is a huge timesaver**

As you get started you'll quickly notice there's hundreds of opportunities. 

I recommend you utilize <span class="bg-grey-light px-3 text-lg rounded-lg pb-1 font-medium mx-1 inline-block"> &#x2318; command + click</span> to open up each one in a new tab. 

This will save you time by batching the looking of interesting sounding projects into one swoop.

A good rule of thumb is for about 100 unwashed leads, you'll click on  10-20 that look interesting.

Next, flip through each tab individually and close any that appear to be low-quality or uninteresting  by hitting <span class="bg-grey-light px-3 text-lg rounded-lg pb-1 font-medium mx-1 inline-block"> &#x2318; command + w</span>.

**Generally, you'll be looking for jobs with the following characteristics:**

- Using words like: freelancer, consultant, agency, or project.
- Mentioning a specific project or type of contract
- Looking to work with someone remotely or in your area
- They mention a high budget, ideally $10k+ 

The way you find this varies from site to site. So it's a good idea to learn where individual sites keep this information.

Some sites might have a budget in the left sidebar and others might it under the project title. Some sites refer to it as a budget, others as compensation. 

Experiment for a few days and get to know these sites.

Next, we're going to talk about how to automate this information gathering so that Feedbin does even more of the hard work for you.
