# Fill the gaps in your consultancy's pipeline in a few minutes a week

A lot has changed since I become self-employed but one thing hasn’t. My desire to control more of my future. That's why this leads service is designed to help you take control of your business.

But I’ll tell you upfront: it’s going to require action.

See, even after I became self-employed, I soon became dependent again. This time it wasn’t to a boss or coworker. It was to my sales pipeline. I needed clients. Feeding my family depended on it and the stress was getting to me. This leads service will help you overcome that stress. 

## "But I'm too busy to look for work."

I know you've probably gone through dry spells before. So think back to your last one. 

Each day the stress mounts. The importance of every new potential client meeting balloons greater and greater. You're desperate, and clients can smell it from a mile away. You go into every meeting thinking the same thing: “I need this job.”

Not exactly a position of strength.

It can be weeks before you find your next client. It feels horrible. But something good also comes from it. A desire to understand dry spells and make sure they never happen again. 

That's what led me to conducting a survey of over 500+ freelancers where I asked two questions:

“what do you do when you run out of work?” and “how much do you make?”

Their answers were a big surprise but probably not for the reason you’d guess.

40% of freelancers said they use social media when in a dry spell, 24% said they sit and wait, and 12% said they email prospects.

This seemed reasonable until I correlated each of these to their income. I found one group made way more than the others.

**The freelancers who emailed prospects made 2.5x more money than those who did nothing.**

It seemed obvious and yet almost everyone (close to 90%) overlooked it. For me, it meant I had the power to change my fortune. So I started to experiment. I cold emailed one new client every day for weeks and soon my income tripled.

## "I feel like I've put all of my eggs in one basket."

Eventually though, you get busy with client work and stopped emailing new prospects. You tell yourself it's okay because you'll “pick things back up if it calms down”. But the truth is, in the back of your head you know you're making the same mistake again.

You're was relying too much on the work you have. At any moment your current batch of clients could pull the rug from underneath you. And the worst part is despite realizing this — and even expecting it — you aren't doing enough to prepare.

Projects seem to end in bunches. One second you're juggling multiple gigs and the next you're scrambling to find anything you can. By the time things “calm down” it's too late. Something needs to change.

## Presenting a hands-free way to get new prospects into your pipeline

As a high-value freelancer, you're losing over $2,000+ in billable hours each month looking for leads yourself. Losing that much time is unsustainable — especially when you're already up to your nose in client work.

To combat this, I've That’s when I started experimenting with different options.

First, I “hired” my girlfriend (now wife, Hi Kieranne!) to do it for me. That lasted about a minute. Next, I considered a sales person. But after asking around I realized how expensive that would be… about 50% of my total sales. (So if I landed a $10,000 contract, they might ask for $5,000!). It was just too much. 

Lastly, I ended up paying a VA over $600 to look for leads. But it didn’t produce a single quality opportunity for me, plus I was wasting almost as much time training them as I would just finding leads myself.

I wished another option existed. I wanted to hire someone like me, not a VA. Then I had an idea. If I wanted this maybe other freelancers did too? That’s how I created Workshop, with a simple offer: I’ll find great projects daily and email them to you.

## "I just want a steady stream of clients coming to me." 

I’ve now helped freelancers all over the world find over $1 million USD in client work. It took a while to nail down the process — so I’d like to share it with you now in hopes you skip years of testing different methods. 

That way, even if you don’t end up buying this service from me you can still have the same success yourself. Here’s how I’ve found over 10,000 great clients in just a few years:


<div class="service">
	<div class="image monitoring"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I finally discovered the best job board for high-value freelancers.</strong></p>
	<p>And it turns out the best job board for high-value freelancers is ALL the job boards. The reason? Great clients are all over the web not on any one site. If you monitor 300+ job boards daily, you WILL find projects that are a match for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image search"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I know where the RFPs are.</strong></p>
	<p>On top of job boards I find additional opportunities on Google (filetype: pdf), Linkedin, Twitter, and even the FB (occasionally). I do custom searches for projects that aren’t listed on job sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image qualify"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I screen each one by hand.</strong></p>
	<p>Background research is key to finding great clients. I get more information about every lead I find before I send it out. That means all of my leads have a name, email, photo, and my deep contemplating / beard-rubbing stamp of approval before they get sent out. A real human looks them over. I know because that human is me.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image outreach"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I make referrals happen.</strong></p>
	<p>This is the newest thing that I’ve added to my system. (I’ll be writing about this more soon.) I now do outreach for every lead I find, myself. I email each lead and get additional information about the project, and refer it to someone in Workshop. Simple — but amazing results.</p>
</div>


## "My pipeline is burning bright even when I'm swamped"

This exact process has resulted in over $1 million dollars of paid client work since 2013. It’s not proprietary in any way so you could probably do it yourself in about 40–60 hours a month (even after refining this process, it still takes me about 4 man-hours.) 

But I think that’d be a shame. Instead I think you should skip years of trial and error and just get the system right now. You deserve to have a steady stream of clients coming to you. You should be able to focus more time on what you love to do.

Where would you invest that time? Who would you spend it with? Those answers are the reason I’ve run this service for 3+ years. They are why you should sign up today.
