## My 45-minute guide on how you can build an automated recurring revenue stream for your freelance consulting business.

Whether you're a freelancer or you own a consulting firm, you need clients. Not just one client, many clients. You've tried hustling, you've tried content marketing, and maybe that worked fine... until you got too busy to keep doing it. 

That's the problem. You focus on your work when you get hired. Of course you do. But that also means you stop all sales activity. All your hard work building a healthy pipeline goes down the drain. 

This vicious cycle is known as feast or famine freelancing. It means that dry spells are always around the corner because it's too time intensive to keep finding freelance work. 

## You need to put your sales on autopilot – so that you're getting new opportunites even when you're busy. 

That's why you need a system that keeps working even when you can't. A system that will keep selling for you, even when you don't have time to look for work. A system you can setup once and forget about.

So you can go on vacation knowing you'll have clients waiting for you when you get back – NOT a surprise dry spell. Just a consistent stream of clients coming to you.

## Get my 45-minute video guide on automating how you find new clients today, for only $19.

It's a complete overview of my entire system that's generated huge results for hundreds of my customers. I hold nothing back. It's the same material I've used on similar courses that have sold for well over $500 a piece. 

It's the same principles I cover in my book that I've sold hundreds of copies of at 3X the price. In fact, this system has proven to help hundreds of my customers net six-figure deals. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars in client work.

## Wait, why am I selling this for so cheap? 
I created this so that I could establish my credibility with more folks like you – and PROVE to you that what I teach works for your business.

I could give it away for free, and that would probably be better for me – but I only want to share this material with people care about improving their business and life. 

That's why I've decided to weed out the scam artists and protect YOUR business by charging for it instead. This let's me prove my value to you in a risk-free way (yes there's even a guarantee).

## My 120% money-back gaurantee
Don't like it? Get your money back + 20% within 30-days no questions asked. This is my way of removing every last barrier for you to allow you to level up your consulting business in a absolutely risk-free way. 

This is the video I refer people to constantly, to make sure they get the absolute best from me. I've made it evergreen so that I keep pushing people here for years to come.

In fact, if you're a consultancy that does a lot of revenue in sales or already have a system in place – you're going to value this presentation even more. 

It acts as a plug-and-play training video that you can send to anybody on your team - new or old - to train them on exactly how you want to find clients for your business. 

In fact, you could buy this mini-course, hire a $10/hr VA on upwork and tell them to implement my entire system for you at a ridiculous ROI.

It costs peanuts compared to the value it will deliver. A fraction of your hourly rate. And yet, a resource that will change your business forever. Let's do it.
