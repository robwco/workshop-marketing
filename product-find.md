# Where to find high-paying clients online

This is a blueprint I've used to find over 8,000 design and development projects - which have resulted in millions of dollars in revenue created.

It's ideal for marketing, design, and development shops - however, I've tried to make it applicable to almost any type of work. 

You're going to get my favorite 2# sites for finding high-value work + bonus resources for how to optimize using each one.

You'll save hundreds of hours by buying this product. 

What you'll get is a walkthrough of the best places on the web to find clients, including how to automate the entire process on a site-by-site basis. 

I'll outline my favorite websites, tools for tracking, and tips I've acquired from 3+ years of building a system to do this everyday.
