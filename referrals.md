# Joining Workshop's Referral Newsletter

Each Friday I send a small group, projects from that week.

These projects come from places like: 

- [Folyo](http://folyo.me)
- Other members
- My network and people I know 

All in all itâ€™s small batch of fun, authentic gigs.

The purpose of this is to provide a place where clients and freelancers can find each other in a way that's not salesy or  unnatural. In other words outside of the world of elance and odesk.

To get on this list, there's options:

1. **Refer a client**<br>If you know of a great client who's currently looking to hire someone, send them [this referral form](https://airtable.com/shrtjRuOvexpQgBrv). If they submit a project, you're in! Simply email me and I'll add you to the list.
	
2. **Post your own project**<br>If you're currently looking to hire someone awesome, you can use [this form](https://airtable.com/shrtjRuOvexpQgBrv) to hire someone from the community. Simply explain what you need and we'll include your project on the newsletter.

3. **Sign up for my lead-gen service**<br> Customers of my lead-gen service receive the referral email as part of their subscription. [Go here for more details.](/leads)

That's it. Those are the only ways to join the list.

I ask all freelancers to do one of these 3 things before they're allowed in the group because: 

1. It keeps the quality of referrals high
2. It self-selects people who actually want to join 
3. Everyone involved has some skin in the game

And the results have been amazing.

**So what do you think? Sound good? Want in? Awesome.** 

We can wait! Looking forward to your email.
