Have you ever met someone who was killing it without a portfolio? 

I have. In fact, I've met consultants doing millions of dollars in client work who have nothing more than "coming soon" on their website.

They get it.

I used to spend hours and hours working on my portfolio without making a dime from my efforts.

Then, in 2012, I got fired.

(This came only 2 months after receiving a raise for my ‘great performance with the company’ — go figure).

That's when I decided to become a freelancer.

My professional life became about one thing: getting clients.

And my portfolio became a huge time-suck.

But still, I thought it was a necessary evil.

So, I looked around online . Honestly, most freelancer websites weren’t too different from my own. Similar work quality. Similar projects. 

How could clients even tell me apart?

What would happen if I got rid of my portfolio?

What if a potential client wanted to see my work and asked me for a sample?

"I could send them a pdf, I guess." 

So I was off. And later I realized sending a pdf was even better because it let me keep track of who wanted to see my work.

It forced me to put my focus on other things like my communication skills.

These areas are what I later found to be the true deciding factor in client-success.

(You can also do this. I even put together everything I learned about emailing and selling to clients in one place: http://letsworkshop.com/emails)

This also lead me to craft an offer specifically designed for people I wanted to help.

So, when I sat down to write my first emails, I avoided broad terms other freelancers used to describe their work. Instead of saying “I do great design,” I talked about “conversion rate optimization.”

Having laser focus allowed me to ask myself if what I was doing was winning me clients. It was yes or no.

This meant my energy and time was spent on the most important thing to my business: making money. 

... It also allowed me to see what areas were a total waste of time. Things that weren’t directly helping me generate revenue were killed… this included; twitter, facebook, blogging, dribbble, reading emails etc.

I put together a script using the tailored offer that I crafted and sent it out to dozens of companies throughout the six months.

I used one job board for most of the work I got called Folyo (Update: I own Folyo now), but less-prolific job boards like craigslist, freelance switch, and others helped supplment my journey to finding clients. 

The main idea was to use the same script and find as many people I could send it to. It felt so much better than sitting on my laurels and just posting stuff on twitter or dribbble.

I stopped letting the success of my business depend on outside forces like others contacting me.

Because of this, I was able to track where my efforts were getting the biggest return. I created an excel file, for tracking leads. Every time I sent a new lead an email, I would update the file for that particular lead source. 

If I heard back, I would again update the file. Soon I was able to see which of these job boards were responding with the highest frequency (Folyo), and put all my effort there.

I also prepared for the future. Whenever a lead would email me back even if just letting me know they were going with another designer, I would put them in a new folder — a pool of past leads to follow up with in the future.

The pool of people I contacted quickly became my most valued source for new work.

To be a successful freelancer I needed to focus on one thing, getting more clients, not everything.

Constantly updating my portfolio website, tweeting, and posting dribbble shots, might have felt like I was working on my freelance business, but in the end it was just a distraction.

I now know approximately how many leads I have to email in order to get a new client. Do you know that number? How confident would you be if you did?

Better yet, how much time would you save having that number delivered to you daily? That's exactly what you get with my lead service.
