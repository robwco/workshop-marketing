# How to get a steady stream of clients coming to you

</div>

Getting fired hit me like a ton of bricks. I still remember the copy machine going off in the background moments after my boss told me he was letting me go. That buzzing sound is burned in my memory years later because it was a wake-up call. I realized that day that as a full-time employee I had no control. 

A lot has changed since becoming a freelancer but one thing hasn't. **My desire to gain more of this control.** This site is about helping you get control of your freelance consulting business right now. But I'll tell you upfront: it's going to require action.

See despite the fire in my belly, I soon became dependent again. This time it wasn't to a boss or coworker. It was to my sales pipeline. I needed clients. Feeding my family depended on it and the stress was getting to me.

## "But I'm too busy to look for work."

I’d gone through dry spells before but this one was bad. Each day the stress mounted. The importance of every new potential client meeting ballooned greater than the last. I went into every Skype call thinking one thing: “I need this job.” 

I was desperate, and clients could smell it from a mile away. It took me weeks to find my next client. It was a horrible feeling.

But something good came out of it. A desire to understand dry spells. A desire that led me to conducting a survey. I asked over 500+ freelancers two questions: "what do you do when you run out of work?" and "how much do you make?" The results were a big surprise:

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3">
			<p class="uppercase" style="margin:0 0 1em; text-align:center; font-size: 18px;">What freelancers do during dry spells:</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="big-stat-number">40%</td> 
		<td class="big-stat-number">24%</td>
		<td class="big-stat-number">12%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stat-caption">Use social media</td>
		<td class="stat-caption">Wait for clients</td>
		<td class="stat-caption">Email prospects</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Now, the truly shocking part was seeing how each of these correlated to income. In fact, one group made way more than the others.

**It was the freelancers who emailed prospects that made 2.5x more money than those who did nothing.**

It was so obvious and yet almost everyone (close to 90%) overlooked it. For me, it meant I had the power to change my fortune. So I started to experiment. I cold emailed one new client every day for weeks and soon my income tripled.

## "I feel like I've put all of my eggs in one basket."

Eventually I got busy with client work again and stopped emailing clients. I told myself it was okay because I'd "pick things back up if it calmed down". But the truth was, in the back of my head I knew I was making a mistake again.

I was relying too much on the work I had. At any moment my current batch of clients could pull the rug from underneath me. And the worst part was despite realizing this - and even expecting it - I wasn't doing anything to prepare.

Projects seemed to end in bunches. One second I would be juggling projects and the next I'd be scrambling to find anything. By the time things "calmed down" it was too late. Something needed to change.

Now, I know what you're saying. This sounds exactly like you. I know because this cycle is an epidemic amongst freelancers. We're so busy doing great work for our clients that we "forget" to maintain a healthy pipeline for ourselves. 

There's even a term for it: the feast or famine cycle. It keeps thousands of freelancers up at night - and afraid to look at their bank account at any particular moment. But it doesn't have to be that way.

## "I don't have time to find leads by hand."

As a high-paid freelancer, I was losing over $2,000+ in billable hours each month by looking for leads myself. Losing that much time was unsustainable for my business - especially when I was already up to my nose in client work. 

That's when I started experimenting with different options. 

First, I "hired" my girlfriend (now wife, Hi Kieranne!) to do it for me. That lasted about a minute.

Next, I considered a sales person. But after asking around I realized how expensive that would be... about 50% of my total sales. (So if I landed a $10,000 contract, they might ask for $5,000!). It was just too much.

Lastly, I ended up paying a VA over $600 to look for leads. But it didn't produce a single quality opportunity for me, plus I was wasting almost as much time training them as I would just finding leads myself.

I wished another option existed. I wanted to hire someone like me, not a VA. Then I had an idea. If I wanted this maybe other freelancers did too? That's how I created this page you're reading now, with a simple offer: I'll find great projects daily and email them to you.

## "I just want a steady stream of clients coming to me." 

I've now helped freelancers all over the world find over $1 million USD in client work. It took a while to nail down the process – so I'd like to share it with you now in hopes you skip years of testing different methods.

That way, even if you don't end up buying this service from me you can still have the same success by following this process yourself. Here's how I've found over 10,000 great clients in a few years.

<div class="service">
	<div class="image monitoring"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I monitor every freelance opportunity</strong></p>
	<p>I have a list of over 300 job boards, news, and industry websites I keep track of on a daily basis. There's thousands of project-based design and development gigs spread out over hundreds of sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image search"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I do custom searches daily</strong></p>
	<p>I use sites like Google, Twitter, Linkedin and more to find recent opportunities that may have slipped through the cracks. This includes RFP's, tenders, and other projects that aren't listed on job sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image inbound"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I have exclusive leads coming to me</strong></p>
	<p>I've built an inbound pipeline of clients (over 300) come exclusively to me in search of a freelancer. Because they're coming straight to me the competition is really low and they usually have the highest budgets ($10k-20k).</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image qualify"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I find contact info for each lead</strong></p>
	<p>I use google and other sites to get more information about a lead and sort it based on if category. That means all of my leads have a name, email, and photo and are a project-based, remote, high-quality job.</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
	<div class="image outreach"></div>
	
	<p><strong>I do outreach for every lead</strong></p>
	<p>Here's the kicker. Once I've found hundreds of great, I email them. Once I get more information about the project, I offer to refer them directly to a Workshop customer.</p>
</div>


## "My pipeline is burning bright even when I'm swamped"
This process has resulted in a hands-free way of keeping a warm freelance pipeline for hundreds of freelancers. It's helped me find over $1 million dollars in paid client work since 2013 with this process. 

You could do it yourself in about 40-60 hours a month (even after refining this process, it still takes me about 4 man-hours every day.) 

But I think that'd be a shame. Instead I think you should skip years of trial and error and just get the system for your freelance business today.

Your business would deserves to have a steady stream of clients coming to it. You should be able to focus more time on what you love to do, and have a system working for you while you sleep. 

What would you do with the time you save? Where would you re-invest it? Who would you love to spend more time with? The answers to those questions are why I run this service and why you should sign up today.

And before you do I believe it's important for me to prove everything I claim. I'm going to do that by showing you the progress my customers have made since joining. Their success is due 100% to the actions they've taken. 

I've just helped them save time and remove barriers. And I'd love to do the same for you.
