	<h1 class="leading-tight font-medium text-3xl ">&ldquo;How the fuck do you find UX clients?&rdquo;</h1>

	<p class="mt-2">That's a question I saw on a forum recently. Clearly this person was at their wits-end, but you've probably asked something similar yourself (although much more sophisticatedly).</p> 

	<p class="mt-3">The answer isn't magic. Finding new clients can be a repeatable process that takes hours, not months - and dry spells aren't just a part of client work you have to live with forever.</p>

	<p class="mt-3">But it does take knowing what to do. Now, you might be saying, &ldquo;oh boy here comes the sales pitch.&rdquo; Right? Wrong.</p> 

	<p class="mt-3 mb-8">I'd like to share my process for finding high-value UX clients with you absolutely free. Give me 30 minutes and I promise you'll know exactly what to do. Let's get started.</p>

<h2 class="text-grey-dark font-medium text-2xl mt-2">I've gone through dry spells and they left a bad taste in my mouth...</h2>

<p class="my-3 leading-normal">Each day the stress mounted. Every email seemed ultra important. The magnitude of every proposal ballooned. I looked for help online but all the forums said the same thing: <em>"dry spells are just a part of client work."</em></p>

<p class="my-3 leading-normal">I knew there had to be a better way – but it wasn't until I invested in my self and my pipeline consistently that I was able to end the feast or famine cycle for good. I want to show every design firm exactly how I did it.</p>
