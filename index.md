# I'd gone through dry spells before but this one was bad...

Each day the stress mounted. Every email seemed super important. I looked for help online	 but every forum and article said the same thing: "dry spells are just a part of freelancing."

I knew there had to be a better way. It wasn't until I changed what I was doing that I ended feast or famine cycle for my business. I want to show you exactly how I did it. 

Seriously... it might not even work for you - BUT - simply looking into someone else's business would've meant the world to me and I know I can help you do the same.

To you, that success might look different, but to me it meant living my life the way I wanted. My business was the foundation for the rest of my life. Not the other way around. Whatever it means to you I want to help you get there.

That's why I started this site. I help independent family-owned freelance shops find better clients without pulling out their hair. The best way to get started is to sign up for my email list. It's one thing I put out that's totally free. No catches.
