# Do you know where to find high-paying clients?

For the past 4 years, freelancers have paid me to do this for them.

Some days are harder than others, but I've consistently found a handful of great projects for each of them using ordinary free tools and websites.

I don't claim to have all the answers - but I do know these projects have resulted in millions of dollars of client work for them and happy returning customers for me.

So if you've ever struggled with dry spells - or simply not making enough money - know that anyone can find these opportunities, regardless of location, discipline, or experience level.

To make it easier, I compiled my 5 favorite websites for finding project-based gigs. <a href="https://gum.co/PgSbF">You can download them for free using this link.</a>

If you win a client or two with it, I hope you come back and check out my other products below because they work even better.

Thanks!

This website is a project by <a href="http://twitter.com/clientgiantrob">Robert Williams</a>. I make money selling these 3 simple products to small client service shops. They work. I wouldn't be in business if they didn't.
