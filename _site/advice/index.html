<h1><a href="/sales-funnel">How to build a profitable sales funnel</a></h1>
<h3 id="first-off-what-is-a-sales-funnel">First off, what is a sales funnel?</h3>
<p>The process that every freelance project goes through to land you a paying client. This includes how you win and find work.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-most-sales-funnels-look-like">What do most sales funnels look like?</h3>
<p>Almost every freelancer’s sales funnel is identical. You find a client online or through referral and proceed with a disorganized, inconsistent courting process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pre-inquiry">Pre-inquiry</h3>

    <p>This is where a client or freelancer find one another. This can happen in a variety of places, like your portfolio, a website, referral or job posting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="inquiry">Inquiry</h3>

    <p>This is usually an <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com" class="off-site">email</a> or <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls">phone call</a> made expressing interest in working together. Typically, this is inquiry is pretty short and simple, containing contact information and a little background on the project or freelancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="inquiry-review">Inquiry Review</h3>

    <p>The freelancer and client will each assess whatever information they’ve been given about working together, and if desired, schedule some sort of follow up meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="first-meeting">First Meeting</h3>

    <p>The freelancer and client meet over Skype, <a href="https://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls">phone call</a>, or in person to discuss the project. Both sides give a rough idea of what they’re looking for, and receive a solid understanding of what working together will look like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <p>Usually you, the freelancer, will sit down to put together some sort of proposal that will put ink to paper about what is expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal-review">Proposal Review</h3>

    <p>The client will receive your roadmap and possibly ask to refine/change it. This is usually a string of emails, questions, and back-and-forth about the project until most details are ironed out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="revised-proposal-if-asked-to-change-first-proposal">Revised Proposal (if asked to change first proposal):</h3>

    <p>The freelancer will either present or send over a revised proposal. This may include a contract and invoice, at which point the client will either accept, decline, or <a href="https://letsworkshop.com/freelancer-negotiation">negotiate</a> a lower rate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="the-actual-work">The actual work</h3>

    <p>This is when you will begin work on the project, usually starting by learning as much as possible about the project and company you’re working with. Once you have adequately researched the project, you’ll begin creating the deliverables you and the client agreed upon.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="how-can-i-improve-my-sales-funnel">How can I improve my sales funnel?</h4>
<p>In order to improve your sales funnel you must first identify what each step of the process looks like for you. Some freelancers might get most of their inquiries from referrals, others might use job boards.</p>

<p>Once you’ve identified how your sales funnel is unique, you can identify where the problems are, like at what step potential clients are dropping off. Here are some good questions to start:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>At what step are you deciding whether to take on a project?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a better point in the sales funnel to do this?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>At what step is a client’s decision to hire you made?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At what step do you want a client to make their decision?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>At what step do you think you’re ready to give a price quote?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever given a price before this step?</li>
      <li>If so, how can you ensure this doesn’t happen?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Are you putting too much importance on any one step? (hint: it’s step 8)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How can you eliminate as many steps as possible without losing clients?</strong></li>
</ol>

<h1><a href="/earnings">How to make 2x more than other freelancers</a></h1>
<p>Freelancers tend to beat around the bush when it comes to money.</p>

<p>It’s common to ask “what’s your hourly rate?” when what you’re really interested in knowing is how much a freelancer makes (and particularly how much more/less they make than you).</p>

<p>An hourly rate can be deceptive. All it gives you is a number. You’re left to piece how much they actually make, where they find work, and other important questions alone.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons I surveyed hundreds of freelancers.</p>

<p><strong>My survey asked three basic questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>How much do you make per month?</li>
  <li>What do you do when you run out of work?</li>
  <li>How much of your work comes from each source?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-results-were-clear-the-people-who-went-directly-to-prospects-by-emailing-them-made-almost-2x-more-than-everybody-else">The results were clear: the people who went directly to prospects by emailing them made almost 2X more than everybody else.</h3>

<p>Yet, twice as many freelancers do nothing during a dry spell.</p>

<p>So, why do only 12% of people go direct, when it’s clear it works?</p>

<p>The truth is it that it takes a lot more work to do outreach and when you’re used to billing hundreds of dollars for an hour of your time – spending that much time on something else besides billable work just isn’t the best use of your time.</p>

<p>That’s why the rest of the course below will walk you through how to make this process 10x faster.</p>

<h1><a href="/cold-emails">How to double your cold email response rate</a></h1>
<p>A lot of freelancers get hung up on what they should say to a new prospect they’re cold emailing. Staring at a blank screen can be a horrible feeling.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve developed this cold email checklist after studying thousands of emails and why they got ignored.</p>

<p>The first step is to just dive in and write a quick, short rough draft email to your prospect. For more help with that, check out my book: <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Emails That Win You Clients</a>.</p>

<h3 id="once-you-have-your-first-draft-email-written-you-can-apply-a-few-quick-rules-to-it-to-make-sure-youre-maximizing-your-response-rate">Once you have your first draft email written, you can apply a few quick rules to it to make sure you’re maximizing your response rate:</h3>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/subject.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The subject line should be so specific it could only be sent to one person in the world.</h3>
<p>This will make sure your email gets opened because busy people look to remove spam first.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/length.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The length of a cold email should be under 120 words.</h3>
	<p>Busy people don't have time to read much. Make it simple, crisp, and get to the point.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/value.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> Your email should provide something of value.</h3>
	<p>Would you be happy to receive this email, even if you had no intention of hiring someone? Delivering advice or tips is an easy way to show you're on the client's side.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/social.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> Don't include links to your social media or portfolio.</h3>
	<p>A prospective client doesn't really care about your work... at least not yet. The only point of this first email is to get them to reply so making them click on your website, linkedin profile or portfolio doesn't help you.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/clarity.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> It should be easy to find the point of your email.
	</h3>
	<p>Someone using a job board probably has a lot of email responses and is more likely to scan and look for the next step. Make that part of your email easy to find. Bold it if you have to.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/reply.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The end of your email should be easy to reply to in seconds.
	</h3>
	<p>You don't want to give a busy lead more work. If the lead can say "sounds good" you're probably on the right track.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="if-your-email-passes-all-of-these-rules-it-is-probably-ready-to-send-and-youll-have-a-30-50-chance-of-response-form-a-client">If your email passes all of these rules, it is probably ready to send and you’ll have a 30-50% chance of response form a client.</h3>

<p>You still have to land one of them. So how do yoy find a list of prospects you can email right now?</p>

<h1><a href="/using-job-boards">How to use job boards to find hundreds of leads</a></h1>
<p>In 2013 I started a service that finds hundreds of freelance leads for a small group of ambitious consultants specializing in design and development work.</p>

<p>This group uses my leads to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. Yet, 99% of them are available for free online. In fact, anyone could find them and land the same projects for free all by themselves.</p>

<p>Instead of hiding this, I’m going to walk you through exactly how I find leads every day.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-browse-the-rss-feeds-and-pick-the-low-hanging-fruit-first">Step 3: Browse the RSS feeds and pick the low-hanging fruit first.</h3>
<p>Look for projects that look like ideal fits first. I recommend starting with established job boards like Authentic Jobs and Behance. When it comes to this, getting started is half the battle. Don’t think you have to find hundreds of people to email every day. Instead, be consistent about finding 1 or 2 new opportunities daily. This should only take minutes to create a constant flow of warm prospects coming into your inbox.</p>

<p>Remember that ultimately it’s a numbers game, and burning out by contacting a billion leads on your first day won’t produce great results. Once you pick the 1 or 2 low-hanging, most desirable projects, contact them immediately. Later you can go back and find more if you have time.</p>

<p>If you open up feedly and see one or two project you’d like to work on, contact those before moving on. Here’s a video of me doing this process:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hHlh3yKUp0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Use additional search criteria when available, terms like ‘remote’ and ‘freelance’ will skip all the location-specific or full-time listings.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-find-niche-job-boards-that-apply-to-your-specialty">Step 4: Find niche job boards that apply to your specialty.</h3>
<p>Some job boards don’t offer an RSS feed. This means you have to go through their site by hand. While more time consuming, these sites are the home of some of the best freelance projects - especially if they relate to something you specialize in. To cut down on time, get familiar with where each job board keeps important details like location preference, budgets, and project type. Building up a familiarity with these niche job boards takes time, but there are so many new job boards popping up that there are constant opportunities to land work. Don’t look for ideal clients, instead look for people that need a problem solved.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s some examples of niche job boards:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=seeking%20freelancer&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">Hacker news seeking freelancer threads</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://larajobs.com">LaraJobs for PHP, Laravel jobs.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://djangojobbers.com/">Django jobbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.railsjobs.com/">Rails Jobs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve gotten the hang of this process and begin to land work consistently from job boards, you’ll find that it really doesn’t require you doing the work. In fact, since your hourly rate is pretty high it not make sense for you to do this entire thing yourself anymore.</p>

<p>Hell, even if you’ve never done it yourself and want to skip the learning curve of curating and hand-picking leads from job boards, and get straight to the awesome part high quality consistent freelance leads, you’ll want to outsource it.</p>

<p>You could hire a general purpose VA for $500/month+ or you could pay Workshop (my highly specialized service) to do it for you for a fraction of cost.</p>

<p>Save 4-5 hours a week and just get the best consulting opportunities on the web delivered to your inbox! Starting at only $99/month.</p>

<p>Regardless, using the steps outlined above you can generate steady client work just using job boards. This 1-on-1 outreach is powerful because you don’t have to rely on outside forces to win work.</p>

<h1><a href="/advice/market-twitter">How to use Twitter to find leads</a></h1>
<p>You’re probably not friends with the hundreds of people who turn to twitter looking for help on projects everyday.</p>

<p>That’s why the most common thing freelancers do when they want to find work VIA Twitter yields no results. It’s usually tweeting something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey friends, I’m available for projects!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey guy - I’m looking for freelancer work..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>help … someone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by waiting.</p>

<p>This approach is like expecting to find your next client by yelling into an echo-y cave with no one in it.</p>

<p>As an example, if you wanted to find the love of your life and had no clue where they lived, who they were, or anything about them you probably wouldn’t post a notice at a supermarket saying seeking love.</p>

<p>Instead a sounder approach would be to actually approach someone who appears to be a match, directly.</p>

<p>For example: you might text or call someone who gives you their number. You might approach someone at a bar or a dating website.</p>

<p>All of these are better options than the grocery store posting because they’re going to where the fish are.</p>

<p>Instead of expecting fate to intervene, you’re giving yourself the best chance. You should do the same with twitter.</p>

<p>So why post in your empty silo that is your twitter audience?</p>

<p>Instead, If you want to harness the power of twitter, try using something like <a href="http://topsy.com">Topsy</a>. Searching through all the clutter on twitter can take hours and you probably wont find very much via their default search.</p>

<p>Instead, a service like Topsy can help you customize and sort your search more effectively.</p>

<p>In addition to using words like freelance, design, and development - add words like “email” (to find people who leave behind an email address). Follow up with them over email instead of just on twitter. You can also set reminders and notifications via google alerts or tweetdeck.</p>

<p>The key is to sort through the multitudes of tweets out there by finding keywords people use when tweeting out for help and approaching them directly in a one to one setting.</p>

<p>Not expecting your desperate tweets to bring in work.</p>

<h1><a href="/requests-for-proposals">How to respond to RFPs</a></h1>
<p>Any RFP I’m interested in, I ask them one simple question. If they can answer it directly, I’ll move forward. If not, I move on. In the last year, I’ve responded to two formal RFPs. I lost both.</p>

<p>The truth of RFPs is they’re usually written with an agency in mind. I know, I’ve been the guy they were written for before.</p>

<p>Shared by Workshop member Kurt Elster</p>

<hr />

<p>RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don’t even want to do it… they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap… just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don’t have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit’s their budget plan.</p>

<p>As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It’s nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky!</p>

<p>For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it’s an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I’m a big fan of guaranteed income.</p>

<p>Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances.</p>

<p>The people who do the best with RFP’s (and are actually the people who’ve made $100k+ from workshop) are the ones who have a system in place for replying to RFP’s specifically. They either hire someone to help, or have developed such a templated and refined process that they can do it themselves in a fraction of the time. This usually means they see it as a numbers game and don’t sweat it when they don’t hear back.</p>

<h1><a href="/masterminds">How to use masterminds as a freelancer</a></h1>
<p>As a member of Workshop’s Mastermind group, I’ve shared knowledge, business practices, and what’s working for my businesses with other freelancers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, four of us in the Mastermind group got to chat via Google Hangout and swap some stories. It was such a unique opportunity to sit down and chat with other designers and developers… something that unfortunately doesn’t happen all that often. I think we all get so busy with our work and what we’re producing that we forget to reach out and connect with others in our industry – and that’s perhaps one of the most important things we were lacking.</p>

<p>We started by introducing ourselves and how we got to where we currently are in our business. We had a variety of skill levels, from someone doing front-end development for about a year to a back-end developer who had been going since 1999. We talked about our ideal clients, what we’re working on now (and how it’s going), and what challenges we’re facing in our businesses.</p>

<p>We discussed how we can improve our skills and really hone our craft to become better designers and developers. I’m really looking forward to getting to know these guys and sharing what I learn from working with clients.</p>

<p>Hello Alex,</p>

<p>I came across your website on twitter and I really love your work. You’ve been behind so many of my favorite designs!</p>

<p>I’m a freelance designer and illustrator as well, but I’ve struggled to find new clients lately.</p>

<p>Would you mind sharing a few tips on how you would look for new work (if you were starting out)? I’m always curious about how fantastic designers do things and 1 or 2 minutes of your time would be insanely valuable to me.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I hate networking. Most networking events leave me feeling somewhere between “so unclean I need to take a shower clothed” and “there isn’t enough xanax in the world to be cool right now.” Okay, I’m exaggerating, but networking events are rough for me.</p>

<p>Fortunately for people like me, mastermind groups are the ultimate networking hack. A mastermind group is a group of like-minded individual who meet regularly (usually once a week) to help each other out. Mastermind groups are even better when the people involved are from the same industry, working toward a common purpose.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to have Rob, reach out to me, and ask if I’d like to help run a new mastermind group for Workshop. Rob and I have bounced idea’s off each other before, and as usual, I thought it was a great idea.</p>

<p>Mastermind groups have three great purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PROBLEM SOLVING: Any question you ask, can be potentially solved by the group as a whole. Businesspeople and freelancers often feel like they’re going it alone, the mastermind group is also a support group. Even if they can’t solve a problem, the group can at least work out next steps to solve a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACCOUNTABILITY: Every meeting closes with sharing each member sharing a goal they’d like to accomplish. The next week, they have to report to the group the status of that goal. Being held accountable is a powerful motivational tool that entrepreneurs often miss out on there own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NETWORKING: Everyone’s combined connections become the group’s total networking power. Have a problem that I know my colleague can solve? I’ll introduce you. That spirit of fraternal collaboration empowers the group.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While this isn’t my first mastermind group, this was my first meeting with the Workshop Sales Funnel Mastermind group, and I’ve already come with new business contacts, new friends, and even some actionable advice to promote my business. I’m looking forward to future conversation with the group, I can’t wait to see what we accomplish together.</p>

<h1><a href="/google-search">How to use Google search to find leads</a></h1>
<p><span class="run-in"><span>G</span>oogle is one of the best ways to find leads</span> but freelancers rarely use it.</p>

<p>In fact, Google indexes a ton of opportunities that you can find by tweaking a few key search settings.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re interested in responding to <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/requests-for-proposals">RFP’s</a>, you can search: <strong>“RFP website design development filetype:PDF”</strong> to only show PDF documents.</p>

<p>Further, you can set your search range to just the “past week” to only get recent, relevant results.</p>

<p>There’s no limit to the amount of links you’ll find on google, so getting specific with keywords, budget, search options, and anything else you can is really going to help.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=RFP+website+design+development+filetype:PDF&amp;num=50&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=91&amp;biw=1521&amp;bih=1080&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mAUSVZ-hIYjToATr0IDACA&amp;ved=0CBQQpwU">Here’s what a google search with those settings looks like.</a></p>

<h1><a href="/the-magic-email">How to get responses from ignored emails</a></h1>
<p>Here’s an email I picked up from Blair Enns. It’s revived cold leads, dead deals, and gotten responses to ignored emails.</p>

<p>It’s simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I haven’t heard back from you on [project/opportunity] so I’m going to assume you’ve gone in a different direction or your priorities have changed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use it pretty regularly. it works because it makes it clear to the recipient that you’ve moved on. Since people are loss averse, their natural inclination is to say “Wait!” and open the deal.</p>

<p>Try it out. I’m sure you have sales leads you haven’t heard back from. Email them this and see what they say. You have nothing to lose</p>

<h1><a href="/behance">How to use Behance to find work</a></h1>
<p>Behance has some of the world’s top companies coming to it for websites and design work. Additionally, all of the bidding happens through the Behance application process.</p>

<p>I actually recommend you try to circumvent the behance application (or applications that happen through a specific job board).</p>

<p>Usually there will be enough on the job posting page for you to track down the people making the decision and contact them via email.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a blog, twitter account, or something else try googling the heck out of the company you’re interested in applying for. It’s amazing how easy you can find emails like this.</p>

<p>Next, send a supplemental email to the lead in addition to your behance (or job board specific) application. If you’re scared the person might not like that you went the extra effort to connect with them, don’t be. If anything you may consider pointing out that you’ve gone the extra mile in this regard.</p>

	<p>Tyler was part of a monthly office hours call where Workshop members got to submit questions for him. We do these every month so if you want to ask a top freelancer a question, <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">sign up for Workshop</a>. Here's what he shared:</p>

<h2>Q: What kind of clients do you pursue?</h2>
<p>A: Ones with money, an interesting idea and a clear problem</p>

<h2>Q: Are there some leads that seemed to have a low budget, but you uncovered them to be willing to spend significantly more? If so, what did you do?</h2>
<p>A: Absolutely. Not a Workshop client yet but that happens all the time with my agency client Blue Million. The Navy App was a great example of that. Quick two day project turned into a nearly 20k job over three months. Don't be afraid to call out a bad idea if you've got a clear idea of a better way and are willing to shape that into a product that is totally worth the extra expense. Solve the clients problems, that's top priority.</p>

<h2>Q: How have you been able to de-commoditize your services?</h2>
<p>A: Play to your strengths, specialize, say no and do work you want to. Don't try to be different or be a one stop shop. Be amazing. Take people's breath away. Say you'll give 100% and return with 200%. People remember what you did, not what you said you could do.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you get such a high response rate when emailing leads?</h2>
<p>A: I'm a nice guy. I'm honest. I don't beat around the bush. I've done good work, pretty work, work people like and want for themselves. </p>

<h2>Q: What’s your criteria for disqualifying a lead?</h2>
<p>A: If they have an RFP that's more then 2 pages it's an instant nope. RFP clients are the stuff my nightmare's are made of. Most RFP clients just want a tool. I am not a tool. I'm a professional. I take problems and I solve them. I write the RFPs and call them IA docs. If they've already solved the problem then they're not looking for me.</p>

<h2>Q: What's his thoughts on RFP’s, does he touch or go after any of those via Workshop?  If so, what is his process…if no, why not?</h2>
<p>A: Nope. That's not to say y'all shouldn't pursue them. Just that I don't. Not enough freedom in the ones I've looked at.</p>

<h2>Q: Tyler, how are you representing yourself when you contact leads that come from Workshop? As an agency or as a freelancer? If yes as an agency, do you see a decline or an increase of replies?</h2>
<p>A: Agency. Mmm not so much on the reply side of things but certainly an increase in the rates I can comfortably charge. It's a matter of trust and just plain being business smart.</p>

<p>Most of my clients are smaller shops and individuals with a good idea looking for help. They're willing to pay good money in exchange for good work. They're healthy business partner candidates.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contact first, proposals second</li>
	<li>Get on the phone</li>
	<li>Be honest</li>
	<li>Be good</li>
	<li>Be professional but friendly</li>
	<li>It's all about the relationship</li>
	<li>Barter don't beg</li>
	<li>Listen for what a client means, not what they're saying</li>

<h2>Baremetrics</h2>
<div class="email-example">
	  <p>Hey Josh,<br />
	I saw your open position this morning and had a sneaky suspicion you had probably read my resume while building out the wish list. So rather then hold you in suspense I’ll just come out and say the wait is over. I am your man.</p><p>I lead a small <a href="http://beta.tinyanvil.com">two man creative studio</a> here in Lexington, Kentucky. Personally I specialize in human interactions, creative direction and the lion’s share of construction. I spent around 3 months awhile back working with Ruby but wound up dropping it out of the workflow in favor of Javascript frameworks like Angular, Meteor, Ionic and Famo.us. I’ve also worked extensively with the Javascript build systems Grunt and Gulp. So I&#39;ve got experience and knowledge in Ruby + Rails &amp; Sinatra but a heck of a lot more in advanced Javascript.</p><p>Let&#39;s not stop there though, I&#39;ve actually built some pretty incredible Javascript plugins myself for my favorite CMS Statamic.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://yak.farm">Yak.</a> Amazon S3 Powered Blogging.
	</li><li><a href="https://tinyanvil.com/elixir/docs">Elixir.</a> Responsive image add-on.
	</li><li><a href="https://tinyanvil.com/chameleon/docs">Chameleon.</a> Responsively generate all the things.
	</li></ul>
	<p>Then there are Ionic iOS apps which are powered entirely by Javascript. Here&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/tyvdh/basic-ionic-timer">open source project</a> you can take a look at but I&#39;ve also built apps with Ionic for Wrangler Network and the US Navy.</p><p>Let&#39;s also cover some other web related technologies. I write all my own HTML and CSS and of course use Sass but I&#39;ve also built projects using Jade, Stylus &amp; CoffeeScript.</p><p>Last but not least I&#39;m well versed in Stripe and it&#39;s implementation from the basic Checkout to <a href="http://tyler.link/W60C">very custom</a> &amp; <a href="http://beta.thevenue.co">fully featured</a> implementations.</p><p>So yeah, I think I am more then your perfect fit for this position. I relish solving problems and I love the work. Stripe is a passion and it would be a tremendous pleasure to merge all of this together into an exiting product with such an admirable team as Baremetrics.</p><p>—

  <h1>Layered Tech Redesign</h1>
<div class="email-example">
<p>Tara,</p><p>So I&#39;m pretty excited right now. The more I&#39;ve dug through Layered Tech the more I&#39;m finding how perfectly this project lines up with our abilities and values. It&#39;s looking like the perfect project. I&#39;ve got a few questions but I&#39;ll lay out what I do know and we can discuss further once you&#39;ve looked over this information.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Project Goal</h2><p>Redesign current content around a framework of modern, professional, trust and approachability. Dominate the online security and compliance industry.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Project Content Details</h2><h2>Homepage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main focus of the redesign
</li><li>Nucleused around concise education on the features and benefits of Layered Tech
</li></ul>
<h2>Static Content Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supplementary pages organized within a sensical directory structure for convenient discovery at the appropriate times
</li></ul>
<h2>Dynamic Content Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blog
</li><li>Newsroom
</li><li>Events
</li><li>Media Center
</li></ul>
<h2>Forms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quote form
</li><li>Contact form
</li></ul>
<h2>Required Non Design Elements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chat portal
</li><li>Account portal
</li></ul>

<hr />
<h2>Tiny Anvil Pricing Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>$2500 for the home page, site architecture and style guide

<ul>
<li>$150 for each additional static page
</li></ul>
</li><li>$1500 for the first dynamic content page 

<ul>
<li>$800 for each additional dynamic content page
</li></ul>
</li><li>$500 for the first form

<ul>
<li>$300 for each additional form
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>So theoretically let&#39;s say the project goes something like this..</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let&#39;s get started with a phenomenal homepage. This gets you started in the right direction with a style guide, the overall feel of the site and its basic layout structure. <strong>$2500</strong></p></li><li><p>Now let&#39;s say we narrow the current 70+ pages down to a more reasonable 30. (30 * 150 = <strong>$4500</strong>)</p></li><li><p>We&#39;re going to need at least two forms for this site. The request a quote form and a more basic contact form. (500 + 300 = <strong>$800</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Finally let&#39;s assume we want to take all four dynamic content pages into this design as well. The blog, the news, the events and finally the media center. (1500 + 800 + 800 + 800 = <strong>$3900</strong>)</p></li></ul>
<p>Adding that all up we arrive at an initial project quote of <strong>$11,700</strong></p><p>As you can see this leaves the project scope and thus price in your hands. Perhaps you&#39;d like to skip the blog, add some pages, or even just have us start the project with the homepage and style direction and then hand that off to some other team. It&#39;s totally up to you.</p><p>Once we arrive at the project scope and content we can work out a reasonable timeline. Just as reference however, a project like the one mentioned above could be completed in <strong>7 – 8 weeks</strong> depending on the response time from the client and any freelancers/agencies we have to subcontract work out to.</p><p>This does not include any Quartz or SVG animations, video or extra interactive work that our team is not equipped to handle. I can however make recommendations for filling these seats which you could then reach out to and direct back to us for creative direction in applying their skills to the project.</p><p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the final deliverable will not be a design prototype but rather a fully functional responsive website solution with a control panel ready to be hosted on your server and put to use immediately. </p><p>What we do is not the cheapest option but it is done with excellence. We take great pride in our code quality and client relationships. I have no doubt in my mind that together we could create something that would place Layered Tech head and shoulders above the rest of a very competitive industry.</p><p>-- Tyler</p>

<h1 class="jumbo" style="margin: 2em 0 0;">Tyler's actionable advice for other Freelancers in Workshop:</h1>
<h2>You'll Only Ever Do the Work You're Doing</h2>

	You only get better work tomorrow by doing better work today.

<h2>Don't Wait To Raise Your Rates</h2>

	It's not about being fair, it's about being worth it. You'll do your best work when you're not worried about money. Your clients want and deserve your best work. We don't buy Apple gear because it's a fair price but because it's worth it.

<h2>Be Good</h2>

	All of these are moot points if you suck at your job. If you hate it, don't care, or simply aren't good please find something else to do or at the very least make an effort and take the steps to get better. No one owes you anything, this is business not the lottery. Work hard, give it your best, always be improving and charge what you're worth. You'll do fine.

<h1><a href="/productize">How to productize your service</a></h1>
<p>When paying a freelancer costs less than the alternative (ie. doing it alone), hiring a freelancer is a good investment. But for a business, they can’t know if that’s the case until cost is established.</p>

<p>That’s why hiring a freelancer is a weird proposition. A business typically knows their domain well. Hiring a freelancer isn’t part of that domain.</p>

<p>When a business uses a job board to find a freelancer, they’re met with a blank form saying “fill this out”. That’s tough to do when you don’t know what you need. That’s why most businesses reach out to their network to refer them a freelancer.</p>

<p>Still, they eventually get asked “what do you want?”</p>

<p>As someone who’s hired a handful of freelancers in the past year, I no longer look to buy freelancing this way. I now look to buy it they way people have been buying stuff for thousands of years.</p>

<p>I look to buy products.</p>

<p>Why? Because I understand how products are priced. I get to see what’s being purchased.</p>

<p>I bought <a href="https://draft.nu/revise/express/">Draft Revise Express</a> this way and the thing I loved about it was I was able to see exactly what I was getting <em>before</em> I decided to purchase. It felt logical.</p>

<p>It made it easier to say ‘yes this is the right investment’ because I was no longer being forced to pay for a black box of value. Instead of hiring a freelancer that says “I’ll make all of your wildest dreams come true.” I hired a product that said, “I’m this.”</p>

<p>Sure, another freelancer might be able to do more for me than this product for less money, but how the fuck would I know that. It’s 2015 and it’s simply not worth the time it takes for me to figure that out.</p>

<p>My business isn’t about paying freelancers in hopes that they might help me some day. It’s about making me money. It’s about mitigating risk in investments that will make me more money. Just like every other company.</p>

<p>Your consultancy business too. For examples, you don’t do spec work. It’s not in your best interest to do work that may or may not end up in getting paid. So why should a client hire a freelancer without a firm guarantee of what they’re getting. How is that fair?</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “Well proposing a solution takes time from the freelancer and they’re not getting anything for it. Proposing a solution is basically spec work.” This is true.</p>

<p>Freelancers shouldn’t do this either. Instead there’s another way of selling things that’s been used for thousands of years: creating a product.</p>

<p>Better yet, in the past year productized services have been sweeping the web. The freelancer gives the business information it needs to make a sound investment and buy the freelance service: namely a price, a set scope of work, and an outcome.</p>

<p>The freelancer gets to propose this without having to create it from scratch for every client. The freelancer gets to decide what the terms of the service are.</p>

<p>I truly prefer working this way.</p>

<p>In fact, when I needed help on a specific project recently, I actively seeked out a productized service. That’s how I found <a href="http://dripconcierge.com/">Drip Concierge</a> by Philip Morgan.</p>

<p>The only problem was finding it  was tough. I know I’m a lot better connected with freelancers than the average business so I decided to make something.</p>

<p><a href="http://inwheelhouse.com"><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/wheelhouse.png" alt="Wheelhouse - a collection of freelancer-created products that take the risk out of buying services" /></a></p>

	A lot of successful freelancers and even consultancies have switched to a new type of business model.

	Instead of just showing off past work, these consultants have focused on turning their service offering into a story and using past work only to support that story.

	This new type of portfolio improves the clarity of what is being offered and why it’s valuable. Instead of a portfolio, their website’s look more like a store or product page. There’s a clear buy button (or next step) and prominent pricing.

	Their portfolio becomes a product that’s for sale for people who want something similar.

	They use customized forms, mailing-list auto responders, and systematized documents that cut down hand-holding and focus instead on delivering more value.

	They seem to realize that their website will never get a ton of traffic, so they focus instead on catering to the small group of people that actually visit their website. They spend weeks studying their customer and writing copy that will paint a picture of what working together will look like.

	They’ve put themselves into their clients shoes and don’t shy away from pricing. They simply charge what they are worth and what they’re comfortable with.

	You can start doing this today. Here’s some examples of this approach:

	What these all have in common is they're focused on selling outcomes instead of selling hours of their time. So why are all of these approaches working so well?

	The easy answer is that they focus on removing potential barriers clients may have.
	Not one mentions a portfolio, instead they focus on making you feel like working with them is a no-brainer.

	No the work doesn’t speak for itself, so before you can deliver more value to our clients with awesome work you need to GET CLIENTS. Believe it or not that’s a pretty crucial step.

	In a nutshell, this approach is about guiding the uninitiated stranger all the way to the life-long dream-client. While this won’t make your work any better, it sure as hell will make your potential client’s think it’s better — and that perception will certainly make more people become paying client’s.
<p>I’ve been helping freelancers find work for the past 9 months and in that time I’ve realized something.</p>

<p><strong>We do portfolios wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Most potential clients just want to see if you can handle their upcoming project. They don’t trust you yet, so your portfolio (along with the rest of your website) is one way to prove you know what you’re doing.</p>

<p>That’s why most portfolios are focused on past work.</p>

<p>“You want to see my experience, well here, look what I made!”</p>

<h2>The problem with most portfolios</h2>

<h3>Constant redesigns</h3>

<p>This approach meant that you, like most freelancers, have to agonize over your portfolio for weeks. In fact, you’re probably always eager to add projects to it.</p>

<p>This can quickly turn into complete redesigns every time you have something to add. Which can quickly turn into burning-out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You envision your portfolio landing you great clients but the actual results tell a different story.</p>

<h3>Counter-productive goals and strategy</h3>

<p>Alone, your website doesn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People outside of your industry have a hard time finding out what it is you even do. Do I code? Design? Write copy?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apparently, big screenshots of your work with no explanation suck at explaining your role on a project.</p>

<p>Your dribbble and github profiles are prominently displayed across all pages, because hey that’s what people do right?</p>

<p>These links not only send potential clients away from your page, they also send them to websites where they can browse through thousands of other amazing designers and developers. Probably not your best idea.</p>

<p>To illustrate it another way: does Amazon link you to Best Buy and Walmart? No fucking way.</p>

<p>Because you have no strategy behind your portfolio, other than “highlighting your skills,” you spent 99% of my time tinkering with the work. The way in which you present and sell <em>your service</em> is a complete after thought.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder that after pouring weeks of hard work into your portfolio, you’re rarely satisfied and the website underperforms.</p>

<h3>Missing key information</h3>

<p>For a client, price is one of the key things they are looking for when they come to your website. More times than not, a client has a budget before they contact you. Ignoring this serves no purpose.</p>

<p>There’s actually many more factors involved when determining a budget. The dollars allocated for a task are just one part of it.</p>

<p>For example, a friend recently pulled the plug on a web design project he commissioned because it went over budget. The funny part is the price never changed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the project began, the timeline estimate was a few weeks. This project completed in a few weeks was a worthy investment.</p>

<p>Almost four months later, the project was still unfinished and no longer a worthy investment. Yet, the price hadn’t changed. It was simply an increase in time.</p>

<p>Addressing a potential client’s budget (and your value) is something you should do. Directly.</p>

<h2>Lack of empathy for client</h2>

<p>Not showing a price is only serving your needs, not those of a client. Ignoring the needs of a client is something that you should never do. These mistakes happen by not putting yourself in the client’s shoes.</p>

<p>We’ve all had bad clients – but take a moment to consider their side of the deal. It might surprise you that it’s not as awesome as you think:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the start, they’re forced to buy this vague thing you call a “service.”</p>

<p>Your proposal slaps a mysterious price tag on them of somewhere between a first-class plane ticket and a small home, with seemingly no reason for arriving at this number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your website or portfolio hasn’t hinted at this number in anyway and yet it arrives unannounced at time of checkout.</p>

<p>Imagine if you couldn’t see the price of Amazon items until you were checking out?</p>

<p>Imagine if items on Amazon came with a 6–24 month delivery, and absolutely zero guarantee that it would work in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That would suck.</p>

<h2>A new approach to portfolios</h2>

<p>A lot of successful freelancers and consultancies have switched to something else. If you’re not paying attention to this change, you may soon be left behind.</p>

<p>Instead of just showing off past work, these consultants have focused on turning their service offering into a story and using past work only to support that story.</p>

<p>This new type of portfolio improves the clarity of what is being offered and why it’s valuable. Instead of a portfolio, their website’s look more like a store or product page. There’s a clear buy button (or next step) and prominent pricing.</p>

<p>Their portfolio becomes a product that’s for sale for people who want something similar.</p>

<p>They use customized forms, mailing-list auto responders, and systematized documents that cut down hand-holding and instead on deliver more value.</p>

<p>They seem to realize that their website will never get a ton of traffic, so they focus instead on catering to the small group of people that actually visit their website. They spend weeks studying their customer and writing copy that will paint a picture of what working together will look like.</p>

<p>They’ve put themselves in their clients shoes and don’t shy away from pricing. They simply charge what they are worth and what they’re comfortable with.</p>

<h2>What these all have in common</h2>

<p>They focus on the client’s needs. They don’t focus on themselves. Not one even displays a typical freelancer portfolio. </p>

<p>Instead, they all focus on removing potential barriers clients may have.</p>

<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean creating a long sales page like the one above. Instead focus on a implementing the following:</p>

<h3>1. Examine a new client’s typical journey.</h3>

<p>How does someone go from stranger to paying client? What did they go through to a) find you, b) contact you, c) like you, and d) hire you?</p>

<p>Do they find you on dribbble, then email you? Do they use a form on your website? Do you email them first? What happens next?</p>

<p>Write down every interaction that happens in the typical order they happen. Examine this process all the way until you actually begin work on a project (bonus points if you go beyond). You’ll typically find there’s 10–15 steps for onboarding a client.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, here’s what your process may look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client sees you on dribbble.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They go to your website.</li>
<li>They visit your ‘contact’ page and copy your email address.</li>
<li>They go to their email hit ‘compose’ and paste your email address into the recipient field.</li>
<li>They send you some brief details about the project, and ask you if you’re interested.</li>
<li>You reply with a few questions about the project.They reply with answers to your questions.</li>
<li>If it seems like a fit, you suggest a meeting over skype.</li>
<li>They’ll accept your skype invitation, and ask you to pick a time.</li>
<li>You give a day and time that works.If that day doesn’t work for the client, you send over a new one.</li>
<li>Once you go over the project on skype, you outline a proposal or scope for the project and define deliverables.</li>
<li>The client will go over what you put together and make changes.</li>
<li>Barring any hidden surprises, you agree to a scope of work / proposal.</li>
<li>You receive payment for the agreed amount.</li>
<li>You have a kick-off meeting about the project and the scope of work expands a bit (which you don’t charge extra for, sadly).</li>
<li>As You begin work on the project, you may have a few last minute questions before you can start.</li>
<li>The client might have some questions about working with you, that he/she was too afraid to ask during the courting process. What’s your name again?</li>
<li>Your start work on deliverables.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now this isn’t the exact process for everyone, but I’m guessing a lot of these steps are familiar to you. Kinda messy, no?</p>

<p>In fact a lot of the steps could be eliminated completely and actually result in an improved client experience.</p>

<h3>2. Answer questions before they’re asked.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Make it easy to get started: instead of waiting until the client contacts you to send over questions you need answered, add a form to your website with these questions built-in. </p>

<p>Direct any inquiries that don’t come in via your website to that form, so that all clients know there’s an established process to follow when working with you. That’s what a lot of the examples above are doing, each in their own way; answering common questions potential clients have before they even ask them.</p>

<h3>3. Send a welcome packet that answers common questions and sets the expectation of what it’s like working together.</h3>

<p>There’s bound to be questions a client doesn’t realize they have until you begin working together. Some of these may seem too awkward to ask (“what’s your name again?”).</p>

<p>Send over a welcome package with answers to frequently asked questions. Include a bit about yourself, what you specialize in, what you don’t do, how often you report to clients, what software/tools you’ll use, how/when you receive payments, how you present work, how you expect feedback to be delivered, your availability, and other questions people may have. It will start your relationship off on the right foot, and it’s also really impressive to send this over.</p>

<p>Send over this package as part of the sales process. Preferably before you setup a skype call, that way the client gets an inside look at working with you and can decide whether you are going to be the right person for the job before you actually spend any time trying to land the project.</p>

<h3>4. Qualify prospects before investing your time in the project.</h3>

<p>Now that you have the answers coming in from your custom-built form, and have sent over a welcome package, you have a highly-qualified client. Now the fun starts.</p>

<p>Once you land the client it’s awesome to send the prospective/new client a thoughtful gift. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just something simple that shows you are thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile. It’s surprising how a $10.00 book can turn a casual acquaintance into a true champion. Bonus points if you’ve written the book you’re sending over.</p>

<p>A big benefit to productizing your consulting service is predictable revenue. It allows you to move away from selling units of your time. It also serves as a good introductory project for new clients because it’s easy to swallow and takes all risk away from them. If you do it right it’s all about your client. They get to relax by and shop for a finished, definable, outcome in comfort.</p>

<h1><a href="/phone-calls">How to make phone calls to clients</a></h1>
<p><span class="run-in"><span>F</span>reelancers often forget</span> that simple verbal communication is often the most powerful way to get your point across.</p>

<p>And when it comes to collecting money, you want to make sure your message comes across clearly.</p>

<h3 id="heres-how-using-the-phone-can-get-your-invoices-paid">Here’s how using the phone can get your invoices paid:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Have basic etiquette</strong><br />
Part of me feels silly even having to write this section, but I have often found myself on the other end of (what should be) professional phone calls with a person who has ZERO phone etiquette, and it never ceases to amaze me. So here are some of the important basics to start us off:
    <ul>
      <li>Never eat or drink when on the phone.</li>
      <li>Speak clearly and speak up.</li>
      <li>Answer the phone professionally (stating your name or company name).</li>
      <li>Conversely, when calling a client identify yourself and your company.</li>
      <li>Never interrupt the person you are talking to. Don’t use speakerphone (if you can avoid it).<br />
We’ve all been on the wrong end of phone calls when a person doesn’t have basic phone etiquette. It’s maddening. So don’t be that guy. No one likes that guy. That guy has no friends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice!</strong><br />
It is so easy to just send an email to your clients rather than pick up the phone. Add the stress of following up on overdue payments to that, and most people are going to avoid it completely. To get over that, practicing:
    <ul>
      <li>A good way to start is to set phone goals for yourself.</li>
      <li>Start out simple. Make 1 or so cold sales call a day for a week.</li>
      <li>Find potential clients and just pick up the phone and talk to them about using your service.</li>
      <li>After that try 2-3 cold calls a day for a week.
This way you can practice getting over that phone anxiety. Even if you flub the call, you aren’t talking to an all-important client, it’s a complete stranger. If it works out, you may have a new client on your hands. It’s a win-win! The more you find yourself on the phone, the sooner you’ll see that phone anxiety disappear. When you do have to call your clients regarding that overdue payment, it won’t seem nearly as awkward.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keep it professional</strong> 
This is especially important if you are calling your client to discuss payment. While the topic of money can often make people feel awkward or uncomfortable or even heated (if we are talking about a non-payer), it is important to remember you are representing your business. Keep the conversation calm and professional at all times. Emotion has no place in the conversation.<br />
The plus side to being on the phone in these situations is that the person on the other end can’t see you. If you find yourself getting nervous, angry, upset, or anxious, they never needs to know. If you keep your voice and tone calm and your words professional, the client will have no idea there is any stress on your end. Just remember, if your client is truly trying to get out of paying you, they WANT you to lose your cool. They are hoping that the conversation will become uncomfortable and awkward for you. Keeping it professional keeps YOU in control.</li>
  <li><strong>Know what you are going to say before you call</strong>
Before you even pick up the phone, know what you want to say. This may sound obvious, but when calling about things like money and past due invoices, the conversation can quickly feel uncomfortable. So the last thing you want is to lose your place. Forgetting the points you want to make to your client makes you look unprepared and unprofessional. If you aren’t able to be direct about your intentions when calling, you are making it easier for them to continue to blow off your payment.<br />
<em>Note: If you are feeling anxiety you may even want to take it a step further and write down the points you want to make on the phone. And be prepared for their possible responses. If you’ve thought out (and written down) your talking points and possible responses you’ll sound confident and prepared when making that phone call. This will again help you maintain control.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Follow up’s and voicemails</strong> <br />
When you are calling a client and they don’t answer, be prepared to leave a detailed voicemail message. Get right to the point of your call and leave all of your contact information. Nothing more. When calling about payments follow up a voicemail message with an email as well. If you are calling about a non-payment keep in mind that most of the time your client is not being malicious. They truly may have just overlooked your invoice. If you call and leave a voicemail, and follow up with an email including another copy of the invoice and link to pay, that may get them to pay you as soon as they get your message. If they really did simply forget they may want to pay quickly to avoid having the embarrassing conversation about non-payment. If you think this might be the case, you can easily send a light email reminding them to pay with the link after you have left your voicemail message. If they still don’t respond, you’ll know where they stand on payment and you can decide what your next steps are.</li>
</ol>

<p>While these tips are designed to help you should you have to call your client and discuss late or non-payments, I would suggest that you talk to your clients on the phone regularly before anything like this ever happens. All too often I am hired to do AR work for people, and they give me a phone number and say, “I THINK this is the correct phone number. I’ve never actually called them before.” From a customer service aspect you should be reaching out to your clients through more than just email. Schedule phone, Skype or in person meetings (if possible) to strengthen your relationships. Not only does this help your customer service levels to soar in your clients eyes, but it makes you a real person to your client. Not just someone they only chat with via email. It is much harder to blow off payments to someone that you talk to over the phone or in person. Now get on that phone and get paid!</p>

<h1><a href="/firing-a-client">How to fire a client</a></h1>
<p>I was recently approached by the owner of a design agency that needed help with setting up a mailing list. She was admittedly a novice at everything email marketing.</p>

<p>She loved my email campaigns and asked if I would be up for helping her write emails to her mailing list - so wanting to see her agency succeed, I agreed. Not going to lie, I’m busy and this wasn’t going to be a huge money making deal, so I wanted to move fast. In fact, I basically provided some free consulting and wrote her first email for her.</p>

<p>At that point, she “revised” my email and deleted a lot of the strategy and psychology I had used, instead writing a lot of empty rhetoric I’ve outlined in the common agency email.</p>

<p>Thinking I had not done a good enough job of communicating with her, I detailed my reasoning for making the email marketing decisions i had made - and why they were better than what she had written. I explained that her email, while sounding better to her, used a lot of the most common pitfalls people new to email marketing use. I asked her for some feedback on why she chose to make the changes to my that she had made. I provided my feedback PDF for her to follow: http://wonderfulfeedback.com.</p>

<p>She responded by basically saying she made the changes because she thought it would be best to combine her email style with my email. At that point I knew she hadn’t followed my instructions and used the feedback PDF to provide her feedback, so I decided to end my involvement on the project. Here’s how I did it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey XXXX, as I’ve been able to dive deeper into your project I’m seeing I may not be the right copy strategist you need for the project at this time. From our back and forth in the past week and the feedback you provided today, it seems you have a solid grasp of what you need - and are just looking for a hired hand to execute, which is totally fine - but to be honest, for that you can find someone a lot cheaper than me.</p>

  <p>I totally understand your position, but am noticing a trend of miscommunication to my requests (for example: the feedback you sent over today didn’t seem to follow the guidelines I provided) which worries me because I like to provide the best possible outcome as quickly as possible for my clients.
As I’m sure you know, some push-back is expected when working with new clients in order to get acclimated to working together, but from my point of view I think it would hurt the voice/style you want AGENCY_NAME to communicate in if I were to stay on in the project because we wouldn’t be able to work quickly enough.</p>

  <p>I can definitely help you find someone else who may be more suited to what you’re looking for. If interested, I can send over a couple names?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a href="/feedback">How to get world-class feedback</a></h1>
<p>So you fire off that email to the client with a crisp new version of their project and wait. A few days later they respond but when you read the email you start to feel sick.</p>

<p>Staring back at you is 20 bullet-points outlining what <em>“needs to be changed”</em>. There’s no mention of the problems they’re attempting to solve, just prescribed solutions – a list of instructions.</p>

<h3 id="dont-blame-the-client-its-your-job-to-teach-them">Don’t blame the client, it’s your job to teach them.</h3>

<p>No one knows how to give good feedback instinctively. Even designers have a hard time giving feedback to each other, so a client has no chance. They don’t care about your work, they care about their business. So make every bit of feedback focus on that. Educate your client with my <a href="/downloads/feedback.pdf">feedback template</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heres-how-you-get-perfect-feedback-every-time">Here’s how you get perfect feedback every time:</h3>
<p>You and your client want the same thing: a successful project. Now, imagine if you didn’t have to fight through bad feedback to get there. You could send off comps without crossing your fingers and praying. Better yet, what if it took minimal effort, because you had a system for getting meaningful feedback on even the most complex projects?</p>

<p>Sound hard? Maybe it’s becuase <em>you</em> don’t even know what perfect feedback looks like. I had the same problem. That’s why I created a special document for my clients that did the job of educating them on what effective feedback looks like. I now send it with every project, and know I’ll get damn good feedback every time.</p>

<div class="post-note">
	<img src="/images/smiley.png" align="left" style="width: 4em; padding: 1em .5em 1em 0;" />
	<strong><a href="/feedback/client-cheatsheet/">Send your clients this page</a></strong><br />

<h1><a href="/client-repellent">How to not send client repellent in your emails</a></h1>
<p>I’d gone through a few droughts as a freelancer, but this one was bad.</p>

<p>Each day, the stress mounted.</p>

<p>The magnitude of every new client meeting ballooned greater than ever before. Before each meeting, I went in knowing one thing; “I NEED THIS JOB.”</p>

<p>It’s the nature of being a freelancer. By definition, the work ends.</p>

<p>However, this stretch was particularly dry. Each time I thought I had a client, they would slip out of my grasp, like sand through an hour-glass.</p>

<p>Their reasons for backing out at the last minute were always different. Some would have a change in plans or strategy, others balked at my rate, but most just stopped replying altogether. I knew it was something I was doing wrong.</p>

<p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I had a hole in my sales funnel.</p>

<p>As a freelancer, you have a lot on your shoulders. Your portfolio, clients, accounting, marketing, contracts, etc. the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>You don’t have time to think about proactively improving our business, much less looking for the holes in it’s sails. You’re consumed by responding to client issues, technical stuff, and everything else that comes packaged with being a freelancer. </p>

<p>But this article isn’t about those things, it’s about fixing ONE BIG PROBLEM those things cause. The single phrase (and every variation of it) that time and time again repels clients away from us and hurts our credibility in more ways than one:</p>

<h2>“Let me know how I can help.”</h2>

<p>When I said this I honestly thought I was being helpful</p>

<p>I would close almost every email with some variation of “Just let me know…”. It felt like the right way to end an email. Heck, it seemed professional.</p>

<p>Inevitably conversations with new clients would reach a point where we needed to discuss solutions, and I thought by letting the client dictate what they wanted from me, I was allowing them to get exactly what they were looking for.</p>

<p>But the reality was this was A LOAD OF SHIT. By ending my emails like this, I was dropping a wheel-barrel full of work on my client’s desk, and saying “here, you deal with it.”</p>

<p>It reeked of incompetence.</p>

<p>After all, these were the very problems I was (not) being paid to solve.</p>

<p>So I began to do the complete opposite and prescribe solutions at the end of every email.</p>

<p>At first, I felt like I was encroaching onto the client’s domain, and barking orders.</p>

<p>Could I really boss the client around and tell them what they needed to do? It was definitely intimidating… at first.</p>

<p>Slowly, though, I noticed a change. Clients were increasingly respondent to my emails. Even prospects were beginning to chirp back to me more times than not.</p>

<p>Just by suggesting a next step at the end of my email, I was able to double the amount of people who responded to me.</p>

<p>This next step was different for every email, but it always followed the same 2-step structure. I would include: 1) My suggested next step 2) What we could do in the event they don’t want to do that.</p>

<p>Sometimes every line in my email would lead up to this two-step solution. Sometimes the solution was the entire email.</p>

<p>If someone wanted a meeting, I’d suggest a time and instead of saying, “Let me know if this works for you.” I’d switch that out for, “If not, than X time/day also works or I’m free at X time/day.”</p>

<p>Think about that. You’re not just saving yourself the extra time of writing two separate emails, you’re saving you (and your client) the time in between these emails.</p>

<p><strong>That set the tone that my time was money.</strong></p>

<p>Beyond just setting the tone though, it actually proved I was a professional capable of making the right decisions by exhibiting these qualities instead of just claiming them. In a way, it showed my hands wouldn’t have to be held throughout the entire project. At the very least, it signaled my clients would just have to muster a “sounds good” in order to reply to my emails (I made sure that was the case throughout the project too).</p>

<p>Most of all though, it meant I was shoveling work away from my client and taking the burden on myself. This is the entire point of freelancing, TO TAKE WORK AWAY FROM OUR CLIENTS. That’s how I look at every interaction now.</p>

<p>You’re probably ending a lot of emails with “let me know.”</p>

<p>That’s okay. Most people end emails like that. In fact, when put at the end of an email, our brains automatically transform the phrase “let me know” to “I just got to the end of this email, and I don’t know what to write next so there.”</p>

<p>But don’t worry, you just have to be a tiny bit better to melt clients’ freakin’ faces off with your awesomeness. Here’s how you stop writing emails in this way:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Before writing an email, start by knowing what next-step you’re going to propose, then write down that part first. Do this for every email.</p></li>
<li><p>When you write your email, don’t begin by wandering aimlessly from topic to topic. Make every sentence re-enforce the next-step you’re suggesting.</p></li>
<li><p>By the time you get to the bottom of your email and it’s time to propose the next step, you’re done. You’ve already written that.</p></li>
<li><p>A good rule of thumb is: if a client can just reply “sounds good” to your email, you’re right on.</p></li>

<h1><a href="/retainers">How to upsell a retainer</a></h1>
<p>When a client asks what it will cost to make a change to their website in the future or “down the road,” what they’re really asking is if they can trust that you won’t disappear the minute you hand off the project. They want to know you won’t leave them out to dry.</p>

<p>This creates a perfect opportunity to up-sell a retainer agreement because you can position the retainer as a premium way of ensuring you’re available to them if they need help:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For small maintenance updates like that it would probably be best to do some sort of small retainer. For example, some of my clients pay $X00 every month to have me on call for up to 4 hours. They have that time reserved just for them no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, I’d still be able to do pretty much any small updates you need (at my normal $X00 hourly rate) – you would just need to wait in my queue if I have other clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For companies of your size I usually recommend option 1 because I can sometimes be booked weeks or months in advanced, and in that case, updates wouldn’t be as fast to get done (with option 2).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This positions you as a very in-demand freelancer yet you also get to remain flexible to their needs. It’s great to have a handful of clients paying hundreds of dollars every month for minimal work too because you can count on that revenue.</p>

<p>In fact, recurring revenue like this is great for freelancing in general because it kills feast or famine.</p>

<h1><a href="/avoiding-the-spam-folder">How to avoid the spam folder</a></h1>
<p>The worthless spammer. The thought alone of being called one paralyzes us and stops us from emailing someone.</p>

<p>It’s for good reason too. You hate spam. There’s nothing worse than receiving another worthless spammy email. The thought of actually sending one out yourself <em>should</em> give you shivers.</p>

<p>It’s also the first thing busy people look to eliminate when going through their inbox. There’s nothing better than getting spam out of your life. It offers nothing.</p>

<p>So, when you’re looking for freelance work, sending out an email that’s very clearly not spam is key to getting through. It’s also something freelancers don’t do very well.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever posted on a job board, you know you get a t-t-ton of spam. The thing is freelancers don’t know they’re sending it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jadottedesign.com/">Stephanie Jadotte</a> is a freelance brand and print designer in Florida. Despite doing great work and having an active Workshop subscription feeding her leads, she was having trouble winning work.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter how many emails she sent, or what she tried, almost no opportunities would come of it.</p>

<p>So we worked together on her cold emails, and discovered something. Although she was spending a lot of time writing emails, they were all almost identical.</p>

<p>Worse, they all started almost the exact same way and got her no follow up emails.</p>

<p>That’s when she realized she was basically sending spam: the same unsolicited email to a ton of people.</p>

<p>To her credit, that’s when she mixed things up. She decided that instead of worrying about how many people she contacted per month or following a script or template, she would focus on sending one great email per day.</p>

<p>The result was the following awesome email:</p>

<p><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/stephanie-spam.png" alt="Stephanie Jadotte's great email" /></p>

<p>30 minutes after sending it off Stephanie got a response from Ron. He was eager to see if she had new ideas.</p>

<p>Let’s analyze why this happened. Stephanie distanced herself from the spammers by doing a little extra effort. Not only did she do enough background research on Ron and his company to discover he wrote a book. She bought and read the book!</p>

<p>This allowed her to write an email that could literally only be sent to one person in the entire world, Ron.</p>

<p>She also got a reply from Ron, in under an hour.</p>

<p>As a freelancer, you only need a handful of clients. Use that to your advantage.</p>

<p>When emailing potential freelance clients, your cold email has to immediately identify itself as NOT spam. If it could only be send to one person in the world, you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>That’s just one of the checklist items that I included in my new Cold Freelance Email Checklist. Each one was discovered after analyzing over 1000+ freelancer emails.

<h1><a href="/advice/finding-work-using-red-flags">How to avoid a client with red flags</a></h1>
<p>On Friday, I followed emailed this lead on: http://www.wphired.com/wordpress-jobs/word-press-expert/</p>

<p>I emailed her my standard cold email with example projects and closing with the ask: “It’s okay to say no but if you do see a fit, I’d like to discuss the details of your project next week. I have time for a call Monday afternoon, does that work for you? If not, then the follow morning also works.”</p>

<p>The immediate reply I got was, “Yes…. You sound very expensive?” which is really confusing because I didn’t mention prices at all, I just gave three example projects. So basically she’s saying, “Oh, I see you’re experienced, so obviously you’re expensive.” Not cool.</p>

<p>Since I don’t want she considers expensive, I explain, “With no minimum commitments, I offer ongoing support at $174/hour. Changing content, adding features, or running updates is as easy as sending us an email. Most support requests are completed same day, often within an hour.”</p>

<p>Immediately she tried to neg me with, “Sorry you are overpriced for the market.” after admitting I seemed expensive/intimidating/experienced. This super annoyed me. The truth is I’m more than she’s willing to pay, and she has no idea how fast I do or don’t work.</p>

<p>I know I should have walked away at this point, but it’s good practice, so I replied again, “I appreciate your candor. If I lowered my rates, I wouldn’t be able to offer the talent, resources, and service that result in satisfied clients and winning projects.”</p>

<p>She replied again with this red flag throwdown: “Perhaps you do not understand what I need. I do the copy I do the seo…You just put together the look and feel. I could not charge for my work if you charged that much for yours. I will call you.” and she did call me but I didn’t answer because I didn’t want to work with her. I just wanted to a good lesson in beating price objections.</p>

<h1><a href="/testimonials/">How to get great testimonials</a></h1>
<p>I’ve used this with clients before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[NAME]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust is vital to my business but new clients who don’t know me have to take a risk at first. Testimonials from past clients can help remove that risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you mind writing (or recording) a short testimonial about [[the project or one aspect on the project you need a testimonial about]]. Even something short and simple is useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shared by Workshop member Eric Davis</p>

<hr />

<p>When I’m coming close to the end of a project, I’ll simply send an email like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh and by the way, I’m thinking of doing a case study about ProjectName on my website, with your permission? I would also love to include a testimonial from you about my work with :CompanyName: – something like this would be perfect:
“Buying Robert’s design services to create a website that is measurably adept at getting more customers is a guaranteed investment.
:ClientName: – Founder”
In fact, if you’re busy at the moment, I can use that quote for now. Either way, let me know, thank you!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This works for me 99% of the time, because all a busy client has to say is “yea sure” and bam, the work is done.</p>

<p>(BTW, this is the same way I approach all of my emails to clients during the project as well. I do all the work for my client, and just give them options or a yes or no question they can choose between.)</p>

<p>After all, my job is to do this project FOR my client – and to lay everything out for them perfectly in order to minimize their time commitment. NOT give them more work by having to manage me.</p>

<p>Once I get a testimonial (which is basically a referral to the whole world), I’ll go in and ask directly for a referral.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey :ClientName:, Thanks for the testimonial this was an awesome project.
I’d like to continue working with you – I have a few ideas for what we can do in the next few weeks to add to this project and make it even more successful.
I’ll send those over soon, but for now if you know of anyone who would beneﬁt from a similar service, I would love it if you could send me their email and I’ll let them know that you were thinking this might be right for them, and answer any questions they have about how your project worked out (I’ll CC you on the email)!
Sound good?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again this approach takes all the hard work away by doing it for them. They simple email you who they have in mind, and you take care of the rest.</p>

  <li>Examine a new client’s typical journey.
This means inspecting each step a client had to go through to a) find you, b) contact you, c) like you, and d) hire you. What are those steps for you?
Do they find you on dribbble, then email you? Do they use a form on your website? Do you email them first? What happens next?
Write down every interaction that happens in the typical order they happen. Examine this process all the way until you actually begin work on a project (bonus points if you go beyond). You’ll typically find there’s 10–15 steps for onboarding a client.
Once you’re done, here’s what your process may look like:
    <ol>
      <li>Client sees you on dribbble. </li>
      <li>They go to your website.</li>
      <li>They visit your ‘contact’ page and copy your email address.</li>
      <li>They go to their email hit ‘compose’ and paste your email address into the recipient field.</li>
      <li>They send you some brief details about the project, and ask you if you’re interested.</li>
      <li>You reply with a few questions about the project.They reply with answers to your questions.</li>
      <li>If it seems like a fit, you suggest a meeting over skype.</li>
      <li>They’ll accept your skype invitation, and ask you to pick a time.</li>
      <li>You give a day and time that works.If that day doesn’t work for the client, you send over a new one.</li>
      <li>Once you go over the project on skype, you outline a proposal or scope for the project and define deliverables.</li>
      <li>The client will go over what you put together and make changes.</li>
      <li>Barring any hidden surprises, you agree to a scope of work / proposal.</li>
      <li>You receive payment for the agreed amount.</li>
      <li>You have a kick-off meeting about the project and the scope of work expands a bit (which you don’t charge extra for, sadly).</li>
      <li>As You begin work on the project, you may have a few last minute questions before you can start.</li>
      <li>The client might have some questions about working with you, that he/she was too afraid to ask during the courting process. What’s your name again? Your start work on deliverables.
Now this isn’t the exact process for everyone, but I’m guessing a lot of these steps are familiar to you. Kinda messy, no?
In fact a lot of the steps could be eliminated completely, and still result in an improved client experience.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Answer questions before they’re asked.
Make it easy to get started: instead of waiting until the client contacts you to send over questions you need answered, add a form to your website with these questions built-in. Direct any inquiries that don’t come in via your website to that form, so that all clients know there’s an established process to follow when working with you. That’s what a lot of the examples above are doing, each in their own way; answering common questions potential clients have before they even ask them.</li>
  <li>Send a welcome packet that answers common questions and sets the expectation of what it’s like working together:
There’s bound to be questions a client doesn’t realize they have until you begin working together. Some of these may seem too awkward to ask (“what’s your name again?”).
Send over a welcome package with answers to frequently asked questions. Include a bit about yourself, what you specialize in, what you don’t do, how often you report to clients, what software/tools you’ll use, how/when you receive payments, how you present work, how you expect feedback to be delivered, your availability, and other questions people may have. It will start your relationship off on the right foot, and it’s also really impressive to send this over.
Send over this package as part of the sales process. Preferably before you setup a skype call, that way the client gets an inside look at working with you and can decide whether you are going to be the right person for the job before you actually spend any time trying to land the project.</li>
  <li>Qualify prospects before investing your time in the project:
Now that you have the answers coming in from your custom-built form, and have sent over a welcome package, you have a highly-qualified client. Now the fun starts.
Once you land the client it’s awesome to send the prospective/new client a thoughtful gift. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just something simple that shows you are thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile. It’s surprising how a $10.00 book can turn a casual acquaintance into a true champion. Bonus points if you’ve written the book you’re sending over.
A big benefit to productizing your consulting service is predictable revenue. It allows you to move away from selling units of your time. It also serves as a good introductory project for new clients because it’s easy to swallow and takes all risk away from them. If you do it right it’s all about your client. They get to relax by and shop for a finished, definable, outcome in comfort.
By no longer trying to get crazy amounts of traffic, you’re making people who are really interested in your service offering come to you.
So when they do, make sure your website is focused on them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Over the years, I’ve picked up a lot of little things over the years to differentiate myself from other freelancers/agencies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>After a kick off meeting for a $10K+, I send a gift to the client by mail. Currently it’s a 1lb bag of Ethercycle branded coffee called “Coding Fuel.” I include a thank you note.</li>
  <li>I always send calendar invites for all meetings and phone calls. It makes sure they don’t forget our meeting and it looks professional.</li>
  <li>I follow-up on everything. This seems obvious but so many people can’t be bothered. I use Boomerang for Gmail to keep me on top of unreplied email threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a client, something small like the coffee creates an experience of thoughtfulness more than anything. That’s a great message to send.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t do anything that bad-ass but at the end of each week I make it mandatory that they send me feedback - and I try to make that experience as thoughtful as possible: https://robertwilliams.typeform.com/to/P8E4Yw</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I send over a design I’m presenting for the first time. I’ll send it over in video format. That way I really get a chance to explain the thought-process and explain my reasoning in a bit more of a loose setting, as opposed to a client reading a 20 paragraph email about the design and maybe missing my point completely. I also do this because design concepts are hard to grasp by reading about them, it’s easier to explain with a visual reference.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I try to send a personal gift around christmas to clients I have worked with throughout the year.</p>

<p>Two years ago I sent the DVD <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07t9NOV7SwY">“Happy”</a> and with a personal note asking them to reflect what has made them happy for the past year. I told them that one of the things that makes me happy is the ability to run my own business, set my hours and spend time with my family. They have been a vital part in making that possible and I’m grateful for it.</p>

<p>This Xmas I sent a copy of Jason Fried’s book ‘Remote’ thanking them for the past year and mentioning that even though I already know they have understood the possibilities of remote working, it’s a great read (and the books make them feel smart for adapting to remote working).</p>

<p>The book and the DVD has both been around $10 each. To re-invest $15 in a client that throughout the year have invested thousands of dollars in me seems like a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Also - at the end of my invoices I end with “THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS, WE LOOK FORWARD TO COOPERATING AGAIN SOON!” Not sure if it does anything but I’ve heard from several clients that they think my invoices look really nice and clean. If you can make someone appreciate your invoice, I’d say that’s a win :)</p>

<h1><a href="/portfolios">How to present your portfolio</a></h1>
<p>You usually have a portfolio to get work.</p>

<p>(It’s true, sometimes a freelancer or consultancy use their for other reasons, and it’s important to make that distinction clear. This email is for people who want to get work from their site.)</p>

<p>In order to get work from your portfolio or website, you need to know what a prospective client wants when they come to your site. And that’s one thing; to see if you can handle their upcoming project.</p>

<p>The typical portfolio you’ll see is a combination of large attractive glamour shots, short paragraphs, and list of details like; client, date, url or a button linking to the live site.This makes sense. You want to see my experience, well look at what I made! As a result, a freelancer tends to work on their portfolio when they’re looking for work or just getting started.</p>

<p>A very common complaint freelancers have is that these websites don’t get enough traffic.</p>

<p>After all, they want to tinker, test, and improve the site, but without first getting big amounts of traffic, they don’t know what to improve.</p>

<p>But these websites will never get much traffic, no matter what you do, so you’re kidding yourself by aiming for it.</p>

<p>Sure it’s tempting to invest large amounts of time and effort to getting more visitors, but even if you did achieve this goal, it’s really a waste of time. After all, you don’t have thousands (or even hundreds) of clients, meaning an extremely tiny percentage of people even qualify as a potential client. With these odds, it’s ridiculous to try a volume strategy. You need to focus on effectiveness.</p>

<p>Freelancer sites don’t get much traffic because no one looks at portfolios more than once or MAYBE twice if it’s really awesome.</p>

<p>There’s simply not enough to hold our interest or be engaged by (plus they’re extremely time-consuming and laborious to build.)</p>

<p>If you were my client I’d advise against this low-ROI investment.</p>

<p>Yet, most freelancers spend tons of time crafting their site. Yes, I too was obsessed throughout college and upon graduating.</p>

<p>Few people ever really nail a portfolio. These are some of the rare great ones: http://draft.nu/, http://neilpatel.com/, http://www.analyticl.com/, http://ethercycle.com.</p>

<p>So what makes these great? They tell you a story. Sure they have awesome projects, but they don’t just let the work speak for itself. They tell you why it’s great, and why they’re great.</p>

<p>That’s what’s missing in the average freelancer’s portfolio. Anyone can have pretty pictures on a responsive grid - so what?</p>

<p>You have a downloadable pdf resume on your homepage? I’m not going to click on it.</p>

<p>You wrote a long blog article about your thoughts on gamification as it relates to pixel perfection in the flat design sphere. I’m sorry but no one is going to read it, or at least no one that will be paying you money in the near future.</p>

<p>But it’s ok.</p>

<p>You don’t need tons of people flocking to your website every day to get clients and make money.</p>

<p>Hell, you don’t even need a freelance website to make money as a freelancer.</p>

<p>All you need is a handful of interested prospects coming to you form your site, and to get this, you only need a few hundred visitors per week.
2015-06-14-winning-freelance-portfolios.md
That’s easily attainable by simple, basic, marketing in just a couple weeks. (Reply to this email for more info on how to do this).</p>

<p>Out of those one hundred weekly visitors, you should average 1 or 2 solid inquiries, that is if your freelance site is working as it should.</p>

<p>To get that many clicks to your site you don’t have to write billion-word blog posts, you don’t need to market yourself like mr. oxy-clean, and you don’t have to post to twitter with the frequency of a blooming teenage bieber freak.</p>

<p>You just need be yourself and talk about interesting stuff wherever you happen to be online. Also make sure to link to your site in your profile, that might help.</p>

<p>By no longer trying to get crazy amounts of traffic, you’re making people who are really interested in your service offering come to you. So when they do, make sure you put the focus on them.</p>

<p>Here’s a few ideas on how to do that.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a headline that is SPECIALIZED on one type of project, client, and outcome - not general ‘I do everything for everybody’.</li>
  <li>Talk about the benefits of working with you instead of just highlighting portfolio beauty.</li>
  <li>Have a custom call to action and contact form on your homepage to make it easy to people to send you an inquiry.</li>
  <li>If possible keep your entire site to one page.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four things will increase your conversion on your portfolio site, and help you find clients. It’s not about the amount of traffic you get when you’re a freelancer, it’s about getting direct.</p>

<h1><a href="/writing">How to write clearly</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Clear writing</a> is one of the biggest business advantages I can think of. By just making things easy to understand you’ll win more clients, more friends, and create better work.</p>

<p>Still, confusing writing is very common. Organizing your thoughts and getting ideas across can be hard. Software never really helped, either. It usually just got in my way.</p>

<p>So I toughed it out for a while. I’d write in Draft or a text editor, but organizing always became a mess.</p>

<p>Then I came across an old article by Edward T. Thompson for the International Paper Company. This article, How to Write Clearly, helped me more than any software I’ve come across. It’s how I wrote my new book <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Emails That Win You Clients</a> (now available for pre-order).</p>

<p><a href="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/downloads/writing-clearly.pdf"><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/clear-writing.png" alt="How To Write Clearly" /></a></p>

<p>The basis of the technique is this: you write each point you want to make on an index card. This creates piles of index cards you can then set out and organize.</p>

<p>It allowed me to group my writing into chapters and sections. Each card had a point I wanted to make, each stack of cards was a chapter.</p>

<p><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/etw-index-cards.png" alt="Emails That Win index on my floor" /></p>

<p>The end result is an extremely clear and focused book. It made it easy to make sure all the points I made built on each other. It all happens right in front of you in real-time so you can really focus on the order you want to say things.</p>

<p>That makes your writing very logical and easy to read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. – Jason Fried</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d recommend you read the article and practice the technique if you are a designer, marketer, or developer. It can really help with writing books, blog posts, emails, sales copy and virtually every type of marketing you can think of.</p>

<p>When I showed it to a few of my friends in a mastermind chat, they started using it for picking features in app development and even planning and building client websites.</p>

<h1><a href="/describing-your-services/">How to describe your services</a></h1>
<p>Have you ever not known what to call something?</p>

<p>I always thought naming something was the hardest thing about of web design but recently I realized something. It’s <strong>most</strong> of what designing for the web is. The stuff you build gets built <em>because</em> you to know what to say / write. This applies to stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing website copy</li>
  <li>Sending emails</li>
  <li>Designing graphics</li>
  <li>Coding sites and apps</li>
  <li>Writing books</li>
  <li>Naming products</li>
</ul>

<p>What separates the bad from the great isn’t great graphics or an intuitive UI. That stuff helps but what matters is what’s written. That informs everything.</p>

<p>It all comes back to the content and knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Why? Because design is about words. Most of what we do is about shaping words. That’s the biggest element on the web. Most online businesses seem to forget and/or ignore it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no rule that says you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.” - Ryan Singer, Designer, Basecamp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virtually every freelancer uses vague or confusing terms to describe what they do. UI designer. Back-end developer. UX designer. Wordpress developer.</p>

<p>These terms have meaning to you but to most of the world, a Wordpress developer is somebody that works at Wordpress. Even people in the design industry don’t know what a UX designer does.</p>

<p>Those terms put workers inside of a box and disconnect them from what they’re actually selling; the benefits of their work. So why do we use these terms with clients? Why don’t we focus on the outcome we deliver?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no rule that you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virtually every freelance designer or developer define themselves by vague or confusing terms. UI designer. Back-end developer. UX designer. Wordpress developer.</p>

<p>A wordpress developer means you work at Wordpress to me. 
A ux designer is a confusing and/or debatable term even for people inside our industry.</p>

<p>Those terms put you inside of a box and disconnect you from what you’re actually selling; the benefits of your work.</p>

<p>So why do we use these terms with clients? Why not focus on the outcome we deliver not what everyone else uses to describe their service? Sure, it’s harder to come up with but I think changing wording like this, even if it’s just for your self and how you think about what you do is a smart choice.</p>

<p>Although I’m a designer, these days, I focus on writing words more than anything else. Still, if I was going to create a freelancing site I wouldn’t call myself a copywriter. Instead I’d write something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I make your visitors actually want to read your website.
That’s what people care about.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tweet about “why do freelancers say i build great websites for small businesses”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By far, the number one feature request I get is members want a more personalized, “tailored-to-me” list of opportunities that is relevant to them and nobody else. It makes total sense and <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">the high quality (and free) Workshop-exclusive leads</a> I find are great at this.</p>

<p>But besides spending 5+ hours on each individual member my only other option is using categories that leads can fall under, and that each member can look through quickly.</p>

<p>This may sound like a mundane task but it’s actually an opportunity to categorize what we do. The end result is something that I hope will focus more on selling a benefit of a service than just a service.</p>

<p><strong>The exact opposite of freelancer.com’s category list:</strong>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/freelancercategories.png" alt="Freelancer.com's list of categories" /></p>

<p>That list is ridiculous. It’s the epitome of vague industry terms that nobody knows the definition for.</p>

<p>Even I have no clue what most of the terms listed on Freelancer.com even mean. It’s hard enough to understand design and development jargon when you’re familiar with it (like user experience design), if you’re completely unfamiliar, like a client, you stand no chance.</p>

<p>Worst of all, a person looking to hire a freelance consultant just doesn’t care. That’s why we don’t bother to learn these terms in the first place. Good freelance shops aren’t commodities. A list of categories that focus on things like what language they code in are focused on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>People are looking to pay for an outcome. They want results. They want a problem to go away. Any list of categories that ignores these results is arbitrary and will do you a disservice if you use it.</p>

<p>When I look for a gig that can go on Workshop I’m not just looking for people who say they need freelancers. It’s great if they do but I’m also looking for people that say they just need a problem solved. It’s always going to be the freelancer’s job to educate them on what that looks like.</p>

<p>If they say they want Wordpress but Rails is better for their needs, it’s the consultants job to educate them.</p>

<p>I’ll be taking all of this and updating the <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">Post a Project to Workshop form</a> soon. It’s free for the next few days, so if you’re looking for a freelancer or consultancy (that focuses on results), now’s a great time to find one!</p>
