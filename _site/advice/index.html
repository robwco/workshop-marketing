<h2><a href="/firing-a-client">How to fire a client</a></h2>
<p>I was recently approached by the owner of a design agency that needed help with setting up a mailing list. She was admittedly a novice at everything email marketing.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a href="/feedback">How to get world-class feedback</a></h2>

<h2><a href="/naming">How do you name a product?</a></h2>

<hr />

<hr />

<h2><a href="/confessions">Confessions of a freelance client</a></h2>

<hr />

<h2><a href="/retainers">How to upsell a retainer</a></h2>
<p>When a client asks what it will cost to make a change to their website in the future or “down the road,” what they’re really asking is if they can trust that you won’t disappear the minute you hand off the project. They want to know you won’t leave them out to dry.</p>

<h2><a href="/high-touch">Automating "High-touch" Sales</a></h2>
<p>Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I’ve sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn’t be possible.</p>
