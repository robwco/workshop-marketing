<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/welcome-packet">Welcome to Workshop!</a></h2>
Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of finding clients!
Okay maybe finding clients isn’t so wonderful sometimes. In fact, it’s mostly just a time-consuming pain in the butt.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/profits">Are big client projects losing you money?</a></h2>

  “I won’t touch projects that have budgets smaller than $30,000. Anything lower is usually low-quality and unprofitable for me.”




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/deleted">Before you update your portfolio again, read this</a></h2>
It started fresh out of college. 



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/budgets">Why some consultants 3X a clients budget, while others get low-balled</a></h2>
Hey, 
On Friday, I got an email from a Workshop member containing this beautiful nugget in the PS:



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/sales-funnel">How to build a profitable sales funnel</a></h2>
First off, what is a sales funnel?
The process that every freelance project goes through to land you a paying client. This includes how you win and find work.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/earnings">How to make 2x more than other freelancers</a></h2>
Freelancers tend to beat around the bush when it comes to money.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/cold-emails">How to double your cold email response rate</a></h2>
A lot of freelancers get hung up on what they should say to a new prospect they’re cold emailing. Staring at a blank screen can be a horrible feeling.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/using-job-boards">How I find hundreds of leads + everything you need</a></h2>
Hello, 



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/advice/market-twitter">How to use Twitter to find leads</a></h2>
You’re probably not friends with the hundreds of people who turn to twitter looking for help on projects everyday.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/requests-for-proposals">How to respond to RFPs</a></h2>
Any RFP I’m interested in, I ask them one simple question. If they can answer it directly, I’ll move forward. If not, I move on. In the last year, I’ve responded to two formal RFPs. I lost both.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/masterminds">How to use masterminds as a freelancer</a></h2>
As a member of Workshop’s Mastermind group, I’ve shared knowledge, business practices, and what’s working for my businesses with other freelancers.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/google-search">How to use Google search to find leads</a></h2>
Google is one of the best ways to find leads but freelancers rarely use it.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/the-magic-email">How to get responses from ignored emails</a></h2>
Here’s an email I picked up from Blair Enns. It’s revived cold leads, dead deals, and gotten responses to ignored emails.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/behance">How to use Behance to find work</a></h2>
Behance has some of the world’s top companies coming to it for websites and design work. Additionally, all of the bidding happens through the Behance application process.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/tyler">He emailed 7 people he didn't know - and 5 of them became clients</a></h2>



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/tools">The Essential 5-app Freelancer Toolkit</a></h2>
My recommended software for freelancers (my business still runs on these)



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/productize">How to productize your service</a></h2>
When paying a freelancer costs less than the alternative (ie. doing it alone), hiring a freelancer is a good investment. But for a business, they can’t know if that’s the case until cost is established.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/phone-calls">How to make phone calls to clients</a></h2>
Freelancers often forget that simple verbal communication is often the most powerful way to get your point across.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/worth-paying">How do you find out if someone is willing to pay for something?</a></h2>
People often get hung up on if their idea is worth buying. The only way to truly find out is to find out.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/freelance-tools">The 25 Best Articles on Freelancing of All Time</a></h2>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/free-workshop">Emails That Win You Clients Webinar</a></h2>
A free workshop from Robert Williams featuring Joanna Wiebe



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/firing-a-client">How to fire a client</a></h2>
I was recently approached by the owner of a design agency that needed help with setting up a mailing list. She was admittedly a novice at everything email marketing.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/feedback">Clients love me for this feedback hack</a></h2>
A few weeks ago, I sent a wireframe to a client and asked for their feedback. Although I tried to guide them on what I was looking for, my wireframes were met with 20-something bullet-points on what “needed” to be changed.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/client-repellent">The Email Line That's Client Repellent</a></h2>
I’d gone through a few droughts as a freelancer, but this one was bad.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/naming">How do you name a product?</a></h2>
I get asked about how I named Workshop pretty often. The truth is I came up with the name Workshop before I even had the idea for the service. I thought it would make a cool name for something.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/tiny">Tiny goals, tiny products, tiny businesses</a></h2>
Have you ever wanted to do something that seemed impossible? Something that seemed completely out of reach? That feeling sucks but doesn’t stop you from wanting it.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/recruiting">You're not "recruiting" you're spamming</a></h2>
You know those rotten emails you get from recruiters. The ones that instantly make you roll your eyes so hard you can see your brain. Yea you do, because everyone does. We all agree these are the worst emails on the face of the earth.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/confessions">Confessions of a freelance client</a></h2>
When paying a freelancer costs less than the alternative (ie. doing it alone), hiring a freelancer is a good investment. But for a business, they can’t know if that’s the case until cost is established.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/subscriptions">How to start a subscription service</a></h2>
People ask me all the time how to start a paid newsletter. Whether you have a ton of valuable content you want to share or you’re simply looking to collect resources in one place, a newsletter can be a great way of providing value.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/retainers">How to upsell a retainer</a></h2>
When a client asks what it will cost to make a change to their website in the future or “down the road,” what they’re really asking is if they can trust that you won’t disappear the minute you hand off the project. They want to know you won’t leave them out to dry.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/spam-folder">Avoiding the spam folder</a></h2>
The worthless spammer. The thought alone of being called one paralyzes us and stops us from emailing someone.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/badass">Making users more awesome</a></h2>
Adding something to your service – is easy. Adding something – that actually helps your customer is tough.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/writing-clearly">How I Write Clearly</a></h2>
Clear writing is one of the biggest business advantages I can think of. By just making things easy to understand you’ll win more clients, more friends, and create better work.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/freelancer-categories">Freelancer.com's Categories</a></h2>

  “There’s no rule that says you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.” - Ryan Singer, Designer, Basecamp




<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/high-touch">Automating "High-touch" Sales</a></h2>
Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I’ve sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn’t be possible.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/advice/finding-work-using-red-flags">How to avoid a client with red flags</a></h2>
On Friday, I followed emailed this lead on: http://www.wphired.com/wordpress-jobs/word-press-expert/



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/testimonials/">How to get great testimonials</a></h2>
I’ve used this with clients before.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/onboarding">How to design the experience of working with you</a></h2>
How do you improve your freelance onboarding process? I use Bidsketch to show proposals, contracts, and get feedback, approval, and signature. A hundred proposals later and never once has someone been confused by it.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/multiplying-value">Multiplying value</a></h2>
Consulting can feel like you’re in a room alone on a treadmill. There’s never an end to the work. You’re alone. The worst part is there’s almost nothing that can fix this except for experience.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/portfolios">How to present your portfolio</a></h2>
You usually have a portfolio to get work.



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/welcome">Introducing Knowing What to Say...</a></h2>
Have you ever not known what to call something?



<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a href="/writing">How to write clearly</a></h2>
Clear writing is one of the biggest business advantages I can think of. By just making things easy to understand you’ll win more clients, more friends, and create better work.
