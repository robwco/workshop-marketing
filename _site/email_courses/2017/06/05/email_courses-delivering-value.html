		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Delivering value</h1>
    <p>I bet if I asked you how you deliver value to existing clients you could come up with at least a short list of ways you’ve delivered value to clients in the past. What about clients you’ve never worked for? How could you deliver value to them? This gets a little tougher. You don’t know enough about their project. You’re not really sure how you can deliver value because the possibilities seem endless. You may think that every new client is completely unique, but the opposite is true.</p>

<p>Most clients are battling the exact same issues and can use the exact same solutions to solve those issues. So if you found one way to deliver value to a client, you can probably use that with multiple clients. Now finding ideas for how you can help a client is actually simple once you use a few indicators.</p>

<p>First use a real client you want to work for. Pick an actual lead or find a dream client. It doesn’t matter if you think you can help them right now. Using a real client is important because you are going to look at their website for clues. You can read their book. You don’t want to dream up this stuff out of thing air.</p>

<p>Are they asking questions? Does their website miss out on one big opportunity? What would you do differently if you were in their shoes?</p>

<p>Okay now let’s make it a little tougher.</p>

<p>How can you deliver a fix to their problem right now? In the next 15-20 minutes?</p>

<p>How can you deliver a fix that’s free? And won’t cost you anything to produce.</p>

<p>You might thing these constraints are going to make it tougher but you’ll find the opposite is true. Constraints are counter-intuitive. They actually help you be more creative, not restrict your ideas. Brainstorm ideas for how you can help a client.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about some examples. Off the top of my head, I wrote down a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A podcast you’ve listened to recently that you recommend they check out.</li>
  <li>A book that will help them get X desired benefit.</li>
  <li>An article that walks them through how to set up advanced analytic tracking.</li>
  <li>A free plugin they can use to triple their email optins.</li>
  <li>A new app you discovered that will boost their productivity.</li>
  <li>How about a guide or email course?</li>
  <li>Better yet, have YOU created some of these things?</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick is you want to provide help for their specific situation. By doing this you’re 10X more likely to prove you can help them, because you’re literally helping them instead of just claiming it.</p>

<p>Make sure you don’t just find anything. Find and recommend valuable things that you truly use or believe in. Now, granted this does take a while. You can’t invest this much time in each individual lead. But you’re not going to.</p>

<p>Look at this process as an investment in all of your future leads. Because you’re going to be re-using these value bombs on multiple leads. In fact, once you find just one, send it to the client.</p>

<p>Send it to them in a helpful email like:</p>

<p>“I sent a buddy of mine to your website and he apparently got your message spam boxed automatically. That shouldn’t happen to a legit mailer like you. I’ve gotten pretty good at getting people off of those auto-classified of spam and into mailboxes. You shouldn’t be losing business because I assure you use are. What’s your hit-rate right now?”</p>

<p>Send that email off. Even if they’re not interested in your service, they’ll be interested in the free goodie. They’ll be flattered you took the time to think of them.  In fact, they’ll feel a duty to reply to you. So this is all good and well but I promised this would teach you how to deliver value without spending too much time.</p>

<p>Well the truth is you’re already done. Finding one valuable thing you can send to cold prospects, and having an email you can send them means you can now duplicate this cold email. It’s time to find more people that can benefit from the same idea. Don’t move on to finding the  next valuable thing until you’ve emailed at least 50-100 prospects who can benefit form this same idea. This is how you scale your efforts delivering value to prospects without spending too much time.</p>

<p>Once you come across someone you really want to work for but the value bomb you just created doesn’t fit perfectly, that’s when it’s time to create your next. Not a minute sooner. Over time you’ll start to collect these value bombs so you don’t have to find them from scratch.</p>

<p>As you find new leads, new leads will simply fall into a few different categories and you can choose from your collection of value bombs. You can even use multiple value bombs through out the courting process with your leads.  Always be delivering value. Just don’t waste man hours on this task. Make it simple, fun, and light-hearted.</p>

<p>Sure you won’t win work from every single client you send value to but you will build a network. These people will have gotten something of value from you. They will have received a self-less act that you can use to your advantage in the future.</p>
