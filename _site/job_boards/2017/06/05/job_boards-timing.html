    <p>OK so a lot of people think writing a great cold email and being the first person to contact a client is the key to outreach email. However, the true is actually following up.</p>

<p>I’m going to break down why that is then talk about what you can do to dominate.</p>

<p>First let’s imagine a John C. Client posts a job on a job board. He’s pretty into the project as he writes his job board and so he’s at the peak of his interest during this time.</p>

<p>He finishes his job post and posts it. He has a meeting in 15 minutes. So he’s only able to look at the first few replies that start coming in.</p>

<p>Now let’s flip over to Freelancer A: Cindy Email Skills and Freelancer B: Kevin Followup. Cindy writes great emails and is focused on being on of the first people to reply to a listing. To do this she saves time by sending the same email to everyone.</p>

<p>Kevin on the other hand is more focused on following up. He replies later and just makes sure to keep bugging his leads until he hears back.</p>

<p>Who do you think wins in this scenario?</p>

<p>Cindy might have the initial advantage. While John C. Client is sitting at his computer, he may see Cindy’s email and reply to her.</p>

<p>However, since Cindy isn’t focused on following up, if he doesn’t see or respond to her email in the first 15 minutes after posting the job post, John is a lot less likely to ever respond.</p>

<p>When he gets back from his meeting, there will now be dozens and dozens of replies to his job posting. He’s much less likely to see Cindy’s job post at that point, since it’s gone to the bottom of his inbox.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand Kevin Followup waits to send his first email. He sends it in the next day even. Now it’s true that John C. Client is less focused on his job listing the next day.</p>

<p>He’s simply less interested. However, when he’s going through the emails in his inbox, Kevin’s email is closer to the top so there’s a higher chance he get seen.</p>

<p>Secondly, they don’t call him Kevin Followup for nothing.</p>

<p>5 days later, after John C. Client has replied to a few of the initial batch of emails, including Cindy Email Skills, Kevin Followup sends his second email following up. John C Client notices the email and just doesn’t have time to respond.</p>

<p>Something’s come up in his department at work which needs all hands on deck for the next few weeks. The hiring project is put on hold.</p>

<p>Cindy sees the email response from John C. Client  and crafts an amazing followup response. She details her vision of the project, what she would do with it, and how she would implement her expertise. She spends a few hours on writing an amazing letter and sends it off.</p>

<p>This is where Cindy drops off. Because John got so busy he doesn’t have time to reply to Cindy, even to let her know that he’s busy for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Cindy gets despondent about the client and shrugs and says “that’s just freelancing I guess”</p>

<p>On the other hand Kevin Followup continues with sending brief followups to the john C every 5 days. He doesn’t spend any time on them he’s just consistent about it.</p>

<p>After his 4th followup (20 days into the initial reply) with no response Kevin decides he will close the loop with John. He sends a final email saying “since I haven’t heard from you I have to assume your priorities have changed.”</p>

<p>20 days into the posting his job post, John C. Finally has a chance to pull his head out of the water and check back on the replies to his job post.</p>

<p>The chaos is finally taken care of and he’s finally ready to go through some of the  replies. In the past week only Kevin Followup has emailed him about the project.</p>

<p>In fact, his last 3 emails are ALL from Kevin. Realizing he’s now about to lose out on even Kevin, John quickly follows up with the last email from Kevin and they begin discussing the project.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t how every single project happens. There are varying degrees. However, I hop I’ve illustrated that following up is much more important than just sending on email.</p>

<p>The fact is a lot of projects don’t happen at once. There’s different varying degrees. Some even take longer than John C.’S project (and we’ll talk about how to stay on a client’s radar for these type of projects that may take MONTHS to develop in the next lesson)</p>

<p>However, THIS is the dirty truth that’s the reality of how projects happen. It’s about maintaining the relationship, being the last one standing. Because the truth is most people won’t continue to followup.</p>

<p>Instead of being one email in a crowded inbox of two dozen freelancers. You’ll be the only one all alone. This is part of YOUR job. It’s not the client’s problem to make sure YOU follow up. It’s completely on you. The good news is 90% of people won’t. Reap the benefits.</p>
