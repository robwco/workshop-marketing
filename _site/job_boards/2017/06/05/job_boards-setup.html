    <h1 id="ways-to-make-sure-you-actually-find-work-every-month">3 ways to make sure you ACTUALLY find work every month</h1>

<p>So in the last video I talked about how you NEED at least 30 leads coming in each month if you want a healthy pipeline.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen that video, go back and watch it now at letsworkshop.com/1</p>

<p>So as i mention in that video 15 of those leads should be inbound (we’ll talk about how to get more inbound leads in a future video).</p>

<p>But if you don’t have 15 inbound leads coming in that means the rest is UP TO YOU.</p>

<p>you need to contact 15 new leads every month if you want to have a healthy pipeline of client work.</p>

<p>that’s 15 leads every month even when you’re already fully booked months out or really busy with other stuff</p>

<p>what this means is that you need to be emailing at least 4 leads per week.</p>

<p>4 leads might seems like a low easy target and it is …</p>

<p>see the hard part won’t be the volume.</p>

<p>it’ll be  the consistency.</p>

<p>especially when you get tired, bored</p>

<p>or during times where you’re really busy and don’t have time to do it</p>

<p>so i’m going to share with you 3 ways you can make the 4 email a week challenge a breeze</p>

<h2 id="first-create-a-template">1) first create a template.</h2>

<p>you don’t want to spend a lot of time on every single lead because, by definition, most leads won’t become clients.</p>

<p>however, you do need to send something slightly personal to each lead.</p>

<p>what i recommend doing is creating a basic 2-3 sentence email template</p>

<p>with 1 sentence that’s completely custom for each lead</p>

<p>that way you will connect with the client and not end up in the spam folder</p>

<p>remember you’re aiming for about 1 out of 15 people you email to become clients</p>

<p>make it easy to hit that 15 email goal every month</p>

<p>use your own words, use your real voice, and think about receiving this email from the client’s perspective</p>

<p>make them address the type of problems you solve for your clients</p>

<h2 id="automate-sending-the-email-and-following-up">2) automate sending the email AND following up.</h2>

<p>I want to put emphasis on the follow up part.</p>

<p>it’s better to email 3 leads and follow up with each one then to email 10 leads.</p>

<p>that’s why i recommend you use software to ensure you follow up with every single lead.</p>

<p>there’s a bunch of tools that makes it automatic for you to follow up and you can even connect them to spreadsheets</p>

<p>the software i recommend is quickmail but there’s a ton of other ones you can use also like yesware and streak.</p>

<p>if you email me at robert@letsworkshop.com i’ll even send you a pre-filled quickmail template you can start from</p>

<p>that way you don’t have to worry about setting anything up.</p>

<p>and you’ll be ready when you come across a lead</p>

<p>you’ll know that you just have to pour leads into the top of this machine</p>

<p>and clients will come out of the bottom like gooey goodness</p>

<h2 id="lastly-dont-do-it-yourself">3) lastly don’t do it yourself.</h2>

<p>this outreach process is going to suck.</p>

<p>you’ll hate your life if you have to grind this out day after day.</p>

<p>that’s fine for a little while, but once you start seeing results with your template and your system it’s time to outsource.</p>

<p>once you get a system in place that you’re comfortable with – and more important you know works</p>

<p>hire a va or an assistant to take over the process.</p>

<p>that way you can remove yourself from the less enjoyable parts and instead focus ONLY on getting on sales calls and closing clients.</p>

<p>picture yourself jumping on a call 4-5 times a week with a lead who’s been researched, qualified, and primed for becoming an excellent dream client of yours.</p>

<p>that’s what you want to get to.</p>

<p>that’s what i want to help you get to also.</p>

<p>i’ve even offered a hands-on service that will not just handle finding leads for you but also the outreach, follow-ups, qualifying and scheduling for you.</p>
