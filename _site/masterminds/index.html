		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">How to use masterminds as a freelancer</h1>
    <p>As a member of Workshop’s Mastermind group, I’ve shared knowledge, business practices, and what’s working for my businesses with other freelancers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, four of us in the Mastermind group got to chat via Google Hangout and swap some stories. It was such a unique opportunity to sit down and chat with other designers and developers… something that unfortunately doesn’t happen all that often. I think we all get so busy with our work and what we’re producing that we forget to reach out and connect with others in our industry – and that’s perhaps one of the most important things we were lacking.</p>

<p>We started by introducing ourselves and how we got to where we currently are in our business. We had a variety of skill levels, from someone doing front-end development for about a year to a back-end developer who had been going since 1999. We talked about our ideal clients, what we’re working on now (and how it’s going), and what challenges we’re facing in our businesses.</p>

<p>We discussed how we can improve our skills and really hone our craft to become better designers and developers. I’m really looking forward to getting to know these guys and sharing what I learn from working with clients.</p>

<p>Hello Alex,</p>

<p>I came across your website on twitter and I really love your work. You’ve been behind so many of my favorite designs!</p>

<p>I’m a freelance designer and illustrator as well, but I’ve struggled to find new clients lately.</p>

<p>Would you mind sharing a few tips on how you would look for new work (if you were starting out)? I’m always curious about how fantastic designers do things and 1 or 2 minutes of your time would be insanely valuable to me.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I hate networking. Most networking events leave me feeling somewhere between “so unclean I need to take a shower clothed” and “there isn’t enough xanax in the world to be cool right now.” Okay, I’m exaggerating, but networking events are rough for me.</p>

<p>Fortunately for people like me, mastermind groups are the ultimate networking hack. A mastermind group is a group of like-minded individual who meet regularly (usually once a week) to help each other out. Mastermind groups are even better when the people involved are from the same industry, working toward a common purpose.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to have Rob, reach out to me, and ask if I’d like to help run a new mastermind group for Workshop. Rob and I have bounced idea’s off each other before, and as usual, I thought it was a great idea.</p>

<p>Mastermind groups have three great purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PROBLEM SOLVING: Any question you ask, can be potentially solved by the group as a whole. Businesspeople and freelancers often feel like they’re going it alone, the mastermind group is also a support group. Even if they can’t solve a problem, the group can at least work out next steps to solve a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACCOUNTABILITY: Every meeting closes with sharing each member sharing a goal they’d like to accomplish. The next week, they have to report to the group the status of that goal. Being held accountable is a powerful motivational tool that entrepreneurs often miss out on there own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NETWORKING: Everyone’s combined connections become the group’s total networking power. Have a problem that I know my colleague can solve? I’ll introduce you. That spirit of fraternal collaboration empowers the group.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While this isn’t my first mastermind group, this was my first meeting with the Workshop Sales Funnel Mastermind group, and I’ve already come with new business contacts, new friends, and even some actionable advice to promote my business. I’m looking forward to future conversation with the group, I can’t wait to see what we accomplish together.</p>
