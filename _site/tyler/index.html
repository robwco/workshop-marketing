	<p>Tyler was part of a monthly office hours call where Workshop members got to submit questions for him. We do these every month so if you want to ask a top freelancer a question, <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">sign up for Workshop</a>. Here's what he shared:</p>

<h2>Q: What kind of clients do you pursue?</h2>
<p>A: Ones with money, an interesting idea and a clear problem</p>

<h2>Q: Are there some leads that seemed to have a low budget, but you uncovered them to be willing to spend significantly more? If so, what did you do?</h2>
<p>A: Absolutely. Not a Workshop client yet but that happens all the time with my agency client Blue Million. The Navy App was a great example of that. Quick two day project turned into a nearly 20k job over three months. Don't be afraid to call out a bad idea if you've got a clear idea of a better way and are willing to shape that into a product that is totally worth the extra expense. Solve the clients problems, that's top priority.</p>

<h2>Q: How have you been able to de-commoditize your services?</h2>
<p>A: Play to your strengths, specialize, say no and do work you want to. Don't try to be different or be a one stop shop. Be amazing. Take people's breath away. Say you'll give 100% and return with 200%. People remember what you did, not what you said you could do.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you get such a high response rate when emailing leads?</h2>
<p>A: I'm a nice guy. I'm honest. I don't beat around the bush. I've done good work, pretty work, work people like and want for themselves. </p>

<h2>Q: What’s your criteria for disqualifying a lead?</h2>
<p>A: If they have an RFP that's more then 2 pages it's an instant nope. RFP clients are the stuff my nightmare's are made of. Most RFP clients just want a tool. I am not a tool. I'm a professional. I take problems and I solve them. I write the RFPs and call them IA docs. If they've already solved the problem then they're not looking for me.</p>

<h2>Q: What's his thoughts on RFP’s, does he touch or go after any of those via Workshop?  If so, what is his process…if no, why not?</h2>
<p>A: Nope. That's not to say y'all shouldn't pursue them. Just that I don't. Not enough freedom in the ones I've looked at.</p>

<h2>Q: Tyler, how are you representing yourself when you contact leads that come from Workshop? As an agency or as a freelancer? If yes as an agency, do you see a decline or an increase of replies?</h2>
<p>A: Agency. Mmm not so much on the reply side of things but certainly an increase in the rates I can comfortably charge. It's a matter of trust and just plain being business smart.</p>

<p>Most of my clients are smaller shops and individuals with a good idea looking for help. They're willing to pay good money in exchange for good work. They're healthy business partner candidates.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contact first, proposals second</li>
	<li>Get on the phone</li>
	<li>Be honest</li>
	<li>Be good</li>
	<li>Be professional but friendly</li>
	<li>It's all about the relationship</li>
	<li>Barter don't beg</li>
	<li>Listen for what a client means, not what they're saying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initial Cold Emails and Proposals</h2>

<div class="email-example">
  <p>Hi Lauren,<br />
My name is Tyler van der Hoeven and I represent a small two man design and development agency called Tiny Anvil. [https://tinyanvil.com/]</p><p>I saw your post in Workshop this morning and we look like a perfect match!</p><p>Tiny Anvil specializes in design and frontend but if you’re willing to take a look at Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/) and its MongoDB we could also handle the development as well.</p><p>Either way I’d love to have a chance to talk and hear more about your project and how Tiny Anvil could come alongside to bring this app to market.</p><p>As a side note, if there aren’t a lot of features beyond what you described in the posting, I’d also say we could get it done for less than your allotted budget. One of the huge benefits of having everything being done under one roof.</p><p>Here are a few links to live sites Tiny Anvil has designed and developed recently.</p>
<ul>
<li>http://baremetrics.io [Frontend for both marketing site and app]
</li><li><p>http://wranglernetwork.com, http://tyler.link/Ygz7 [Website frontend and mobile app]</p></li><li><p>https://www.dentaquestinstitute.org [Frontend]</p></li><li><p>https://tinyanvil.com/elixir [Advanced Javascript plugin and the site I’m selling it on]</p></li></ul>

Idea inception to design execution.</p><p>My experience ranges from farm hand, to Pepsi merchandiser, to professional photographer, to front-end web designer &amp; developer. I’ve worked for companies like Wrangler and the Navy on their advertising and web teams all the way down to pro bono print and video work for missionaries in Eastern Asia.</p><p>Here are a few of my own projects, apart from Tiny Anvil work.</p><h2>Completed Projects</h2>

<h2>Baremetrics</h2>
<div class="email-example">
	  <p>Hey Josh,<br />
	I saw your open position this morning and had a sneaky suspicion you had probably read my resume while building out the wish list. So rather then hold you in suspense I’ll just come out and say the wait is over. I am your man.</p><p>I lead a small <a href="http://beta.tinyanvil.com">two man creative studio</a> here in Lexington, Kentucky. Personally I specialize in human interactions, creative direction and the lion’s share of construction. I spent around 3 months awhile back working with Ruby but wound up dropping it out of the workflow in favor of Javascript frameworks like Angular, Meteor, Ionic and Famo.us. I’ve also worked extensively with the Javascript build systems Grunt and Gulp. So I&#39;ve got experience and knowledge in Ruby + Rails &amp; Sinatra but a heck of a lot more in advanced Javascript.</p><p>Let&#39;s not stop there though, I&#39;ve actually built some pretty incredible Javascript plugins myself for my favorite CMS Statamic.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://yak.farm">Yak.</a> Amazon S3 Powered Blogging.
	</li><li><a href="https://tinyanvil.com/elixir/docs">Elixir.</a> Responsive image add-on.
	</li><li><a href="https://tinyanvil.com/chameleon/docs">Chameleon.</a> Responsively generate all the things.
	</li></ul>
	<p>Then there are Ionic iOS apps which are powered entirely by Javascript. Here&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/tyvdh/basic-ionic-timer">open source project</a> you can take a look at but I&#39;ve also built apps with Ionic for Wrangler Network and the US Navy.</p><p>Let&#39;s also cover some other web related technologies. I write all my own HTML and CSS and of course use Sass but I&#39;ve also built projects using Jade, Stylus &amp; CoffeeScript.</p><p>Last but not least I&#39;m well versed in Stripe and it&#39;s implementation from the basic Checkout to <a href="http://tyler.link/W60C">very custom</a> &amp; <a href="http://beta.thevenue.co">fully featured</a> implementations.</p><p>So yeah, I think I am more then your perfect fit for this position. I relish solving problems and I love the work. Stripe is a passion and it would be a tremendous pleasure to merge all of this together into an exiting product with such an admirable team as Baremetrics.</p><p>—

  <h1>Layered Tech Redesign</h1>
<div class="email-example">
<p>Tara,</p><p>So I&#39;m pretty excited right now. The more I&#39;ve dug through Layered Tech the more I&#39;m finding how perfectly this project lines up with our abilities and values. It&#39;s looking like the perfect project. I&#39;ve got a few questions but I&#39;ll lay out what I do know and we can discuss further once you&#39;ve looked over this information.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Project Goal</h2><p>Redesign current content around a framework of modern, professional, trust and approachability. Dominate the online security and compliance industry.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Project Content Details</h2><h2>Homepage</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main focus of the redesign
</li><li>Nucleused around concise education on the features and benefits of Layered Tech
</li></ul>
<h2>Static Content Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supplementary pages organized within a sensical directory structure for convenient discovery at the appropriate times
</li></ul>
<h2>Dynamic Content Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blog
</li><li>Newsroom
</li><li>Events
</li><li>Media Center
</li></ul>
<h2>Forms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quote form
</li><li>Contact form
</li></ul>
<h2>Required Non Design Elements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chat portal
</li><li>Account portal
</li></ul>

<hr />
<h2>Tiny Anvil Pricing Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>$2500 for the home page, site architecture and style guide

<ul>
<li>$150 for each additional static page
</li></ul>
</li><li>$1500 for the first dynamic content page 

<ul>
<li>$800 for each additional dynamic content page
</li></ul>
</li><li>$500 for the first form

<ul>
<li>$300 for each additional form
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>So theoretically let&#39;s say the project goes something like this..</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let&#39;s get started with a phenomenal homepage. This gets you started in the right direction with a style guide, the overall feel of the site and its basic layout structure. <strong>$2500</strong></p></li><li><p>Now let&#39;s say we narrow the current 70+ pages down to a more reasonable 30. (30 * 150 = <strong>$4500</strong>)</p></li><li><p>We&#39;re going to need at least two forms for this site. The request a quote form and a more basic contact form. (500 + 300 = <strong>$800</strong>)</p></li><li><p>Finally let&#39;s assume we want to take all four dynamic content pages into this design as well. The blog, the news, the events and finally the media center. (1500 + 800 + 800 + 800 = <strong>$3900</strong>)</p></li></ul>
<p>Adding that all up we arrive at an initial project quote of <strong>$11,700</strong></p><p>As you can see this leaves the project scope and thus price in your hands. Perhaps you&#39;d like to skip the blog, add some pages, or even just have us start the project with the homepage and style direction and then hand that off to some other team. It&#39;s totally up to you.</p><p>Once we arrive at the project scope and content we can work out a reasonable timeline. Just as reference however, a project like the one mentioned above could be completed in <strong>7 – 8 weeks</strong> depending on the response time from the client and any freelancers/agencies we have to subcontract work out to.</p><p>This does not include any Quartz or SVG animations, video or extra interactive work that our team is not equipped to handle. I can however make recommendations for filling these seats which you could then reach out to and direct back to us for creative direction in applying their skills to the project.</p><p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the final deliverable will not be a design prototype but rather a fully functional responsive website solution with a control panel ready to be hosted on your server and put to use immediately. </p><p>What we do is not the cheapest option but it is done with excellence. We take great pride in our code quality and client relationships. I have no doubt in my mind that together we could create something that would place Layered Tech head and shoulders above the rest of a very competitive industry.</p><p>-- Tyler</p>

<h1 class="jumbo" style="margin: 2em 0 0;">Tyler's actionable advice for other Freelancers in Workshop:</h1>
<h2>You'll Only Ever Do the Work You're Doing</h2>

	You only get better work tomorrow by doing better work today.

<h2>Don't Wait To Raise Your Rates</h2>

	It's not about being fair, it's about being worth it. You'll do your best work when you're not worried about money. Your clients want and deserve your best work. We don't buy Apple gear because it's a fair price but because it's worth it.

<h2>Be Good</h2>

	All of these are moot points if you suck at your job. If you hate it, don't care, or simply aren't good please find something else to do or at the very least make an effort and take the steps to get better. No one owes you anything, this is business not the lottery. Work hard, give it your best, always be improving and charge what you're worth. You'll do fine.
