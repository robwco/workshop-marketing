		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Tiny goals, tiny products, tiny businesses</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to do something that seemed impossible? Something that seemed completely out of reach? That feeling sucks but doesn’t stop you from wanting it.</p>

<p>It’s usually something big you want too. You might even have one or two of these goals right now, like building a big company, finding your soul mate, or landing a million dollar client. Any way you dice them those are big challenges.</p>

<p>But they shouldn’t be. All of these things should actually start off small, like things that are long-lasting and strong. Strong things, whether they’re natural or man-made tend to start small.</p>

<p>A great huge oak tree starts from a seed. It takes hundreds of years to become strong and mighty. Maybe we should give ourselves the same opportunity.</p>

<p>Two life-long partners in a loving relationship start as complete strangers. They start by meeting with a tiny interaction. Usually, the word “hello.”. Thousands of hours of conversations and intimacy would never happen if it wasn’t for that fragile tiny interaction.</p>

<p>Not just that, things that stay small for longer tend to be better. A tree that shoots up too quickly, doesn’t have the necessary roots beneath it to sustain it’s weight. A large federal mandate will usually waste billions of dollars in tax payer money, something a small local government isn’t likely to do.</p>

<p>When you have large goals and race to meet them, what are you glossing over?</p>

<p>Starting small is an advantage because you escape the pressures of a large object. You can hide, you can learn, you can grow.</p>

<p>It’s the same in business. Starting with millions of dollars (through investments or whatever) just means you are starting with a big target on your back.</p>

<p>I’m proud of the way my business started. It started tiny. I started with a landing page I made in minutes. My product was a newsletter. To one person. Tiny.</p>

<p>Yet, it’s made me hundreds of thousands of dollars and advanced my career to reach some of my biggest dreams - so why are we so hesitant to start something tiny?</p>

<p>Are you? If so, share with me your one tiny idea. Let’s make it even tinier. Email me (robert@letsworkshop.com).</p>

<p>Disagree with me? What great lasting things (including in nature) start out large?</p>
