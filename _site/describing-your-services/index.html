		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">How to describe your services</h1>
    <p>Have you ever not known what to call something?</p>

<p>I always thought naming something was the hardest thing about of web design but recently I realized something. It’s <strong>most</strong> of what designing for the web is. The stuff you build gets built <em>because</em> you to know what to say / write. This applies to stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing website copy</li>
  <li>Sending emails</li>
  <li>Designing graphics</li>
  <li>Coding sites and apps</li>
  <li>Writing books</li>
  <li>Naming products</li>
</ul>

<p>What separates the bad from the great isn’t great graphics or an intuitive UI. That stuff helps but what matters is what’s written. That informs everything.</p>

<p>It all comes back to the content and knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Why? Because design is about words. Most of what we do is about shaping words. That’s the biggest element on the web. Most online businesses seem to forget and/or ignore it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no rule that says you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.” - Ryan Singer, Designer, Basecamp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virtually every freelancer uses vague or confusing terms to describe what they do. UI designer. Back-end developer. UX designer. Wordpress developer.</p>

<p>These terms have meaning to you but to most of the world, a Wordpress developer is somebody that works at Wordpress. Even people in the design industry don’t know what a UX designer does.</p>

<p>Those terms put workers inside of a box and disconnect them from what they’re actually selling; the benefits of their work. So why do we use these terms with clients? Why don’t we focus on the outcome we deliver?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no rule that you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virtually every freelance designer or developer define themselves by vague or confusing terms. UI designer. Back-end developer. UX designer. Wordpress developer.</p>

<p>A wordpress developer means you work at Wordpress to me. 
A ux designer is a confusing and/or debatable term even for people inside our industry.</p>

<p>Those terms put you inside of a box and disconnect you from what you’re actually selling; the benefits of your work.</p>

<p>So why do we use these terms with clients? Why not focus on the outcome we deliver not what everyone else uses to describe their service? Sure, it’s harder to come up with but I think changing wording like this, even if it’s just for your self and how you think about what you do is a smart choice.</p>

<p>Although I’m a designer, these days, I focus on writing words more than anything else. Still, if I was going to create a freelancing site I wouldn’t call myself a copywriter. Instead I’d write something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I make your visitors actually want to read your website.
That’s what people care about.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tweet about “why do freelancers say i build great websites for small businesses”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By far, the number one feature request I get is members want a more personalized, “tailored-to-me” list of opportunities that is relevant to them and nobody else. It makes total sense and <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">the high quality (and free) Workshop-exclusive leads</a> I find are great at this.</p>

<p>But besides spending 5+ hours on each individual member my only other option is using categories that leads can fall under, and that each member can look through quickly.</p>

<p>This may sound like a mundane task but it’s actually an opportunity to categorize what we do. The end result is something that I hope will focus more on selling a benefit of a service than just a service.</p>

<p><strong>The exact opposite of freelancer.com’s category list:</strong>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/freelancercategories.png" alt="Freelancer.com's list of categories" /></p>

<p>That list is ridiculous. It’s the epitome of vague industry terms that nobody knows the definition for.</p>

<p>Even I have no clue what most of the terms listed on Freelancer.com even mean. It’s hard enough to understand design and development jargon when you’re familiar with it (like user experience design), if you’re completely unfamiliar, like a client, you stand no chance.</p>

<p>Worst of all, a person looking to hire a freelance consultant just doesn’t care. That’s why we don’t bother to learn these terms in the first place. Good freelance shops aren’t commodities. A list of categories that focus on things like what language they code in are focused on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>People are looking to pay for an outcome. They want results. They want a problem to go away. Any list of categories that ignores these results is arbitrary and will do you a disservice if you use it.</p>

<p>When I look for a gig that can go on Workshop I’m not just looking for people who say they need freelancers. It’s great if they do but I’m also looking for people that say they just need a problem solved. It’s always going to be the freelancer’s job to educate them on what that looks like.</p>

<p>If they say they want Wordpress but Rails is better for their needs, it’s the consultants job to educate them.</p>

<p>I’ll be taking all of this and updating the <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">Post a Project to Workshop form</a> soon. It’s free for the next few days, so if you’re looking for a freelancer or consultancy (that focuses on results), now’s a great time to find one!</p>

	<p>Does it feel like clients expect near-instant gratification at all times? That type of client relationship kills your productivity and work-life balance... leaving you feeling burnt out.</p>
