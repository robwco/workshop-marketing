		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">How to start a subscription service</h1>
    <p>People ask me all the time how to start a paid newsletter. Whether you have a ton of valuable content you want to share or you’re simply looking to collect resources in one place, a newsletter can be a great way of providing value.</p>

<p>Charging for the value you send can be profitable.</p>

<p>In November of 2013, I started a small private newsletter called Workshop. I charged subscribers a monthly fee to join – and they got the best freelance jobs on the web neatly collected and sent to them every weekday. It was a win-win. Soon there were a lot of similar services popping up.</p>

<p>Here’s how <em>I</em> started my profitable subscription service (that generates recurring revenue every month):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I had a small (free) email list first. These 200 people were the first to hear about my paid newsletter. I did other marketing, like writing blog posts, joint ventures, and more, but nothing mattered as much as when I emailed useful, value-filled articles to my mailing list. It printed me money. All other marketing should be aimed at getting people on a free email list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I focused on making my subscribers better, not improving my newsletter. Most of my effort went to not just sending the best leads I could find but also educating freelancers about how to contact and win work from these leads. If they weren’t able to do that, nothing else would have mattered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started charging immediately. I launched to 1 paying customer. I spent 4 hours on launch day finding leads that were a perfect fit for my one subscriber. It was all worth it when he immediately replied to my email and said “holy shit, this is awesome.” Launch. Now. Mailchimp exists, Campaign Monitor exists, Gumroad exists, Memberful exists. You exist. You have this idea. Now do it. That’s all you need. Create a site in 10 minutes or less, link it to something where you can get paid (I recommend using Memberful and Campaign Monitor but you can basically duct tape anything together with Zapier). Improve as you go.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you get even 1 paid subscriber (like me) than you know people are willing to pay for your idea. If you don’t, well at least you know that too.</p>

	<p>Does it feel like clients expect near-instant gratification at all times? That type of client relationship kills your productivity and work-life balance... leaving you feeling burnt out.</p>
