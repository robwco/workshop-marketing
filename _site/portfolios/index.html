  <h1 class="leading-tight text-grey-darkest mb-2">How to design a frontend portfolio that actually gets you clients</h1>

  <p>I’ve been helping freelancers find work for the past 9 months and in that time I’ve realized something.
We do portfolios wrong.
Most potential clients just want to see if you can handle their upcoming project. They don’t trust you yet, so your portfolio (along with the rest of your website) is one way to prove you know what you’re doing.
That’s why most portfolios are focused on past work.
You want to see my experience, well here, look what I made!
The problem with most portfolios
 
Constant redesigns
 
This approach meant that I, like most freelancers, would agonize over my portfolio for weeks. In fact, I was always eager to add projects to it.
This turned into completely redesigning my entire portfolio every time I had something to add. Which turned into burn-out. 
I envisioned my portfolio landing me great clients but the actual results told a different story.
Counter-productive goals and strategy
 
Alone, my website didn’t make any sense. 
People outside of my industry had a hard time finding out what it was I even did. Did I code? Design? Write copy? 
Apparently, big screenshots of my work with no explanation suck at explaining my role on a project.
Plus, my dribbble and github profiles were prominently displayed across all pages, because hey that’s what people do right?
These links not only sent potential clients away from my page, they also sent them to websites where they could browse through thousands of other amazing designers and developers. Probably not my best idea.
To illustrate it another way: does Amazon link you to Best Buy and Walmart?
Because I had no strategy behind my portfolio, other than to highlight my skills, I spent 99% of my time tinkering with the work. The way in which I presented and sold my service was a complete after thought.
It’s no wonder that after pouring weeks of hard work into my portfolio, I was rarely satisfied and the website underperformed.
Missing key information
 
For a client, price is one of the key things they are looking for when they come to your website. More times than not, a client has a budget before they contact you. Ignoring this serves no purpose.
There’s actually many more factors involved when determining a budget. The dollars allocated for a task are just one part of it.
For example, a friend recently pulled the plug on a web design project he commissioned because it went over budget. The funny part is the price never changed. 
When the project began, the timeline estimate was a few weeks. This project completed in a few weeks was a worthy investment.
Almost four months later, the project was still unfinished and no longer a worthy investment. Yet, the price hadn’t changed. It was simply an increase in time.
Addressing a potential client’s budget (and your value) is something I wish I did. Directly.
Lack of empathy for client
 
Not showing a price is only serving your needs, not those of a client. Ignoring the needs of a client is something that you should never do. These mistakes happen by not putting ourself in the client’s shoes.
We’ve all had bad clients–but take a moment to consider the deal a client gets on their side. It might surprise you that it’s not as awesome as you think: 
At the start, they’re forced to buy this vague thing you call a “service.”
Your proposal slaps a mysterious price tag on it of somewhere between a first-class plane ticket and a small home, with seemingly no reason for arriving at this number. 
Your website or portfolio hasn’t hinted at this number in anyway and yet it arrives unannounced at time of checkout.
Imagine if you couldn’t see the price of Amazon items until you were checking out?
Imagine if items on Amazon came with a 6–24 month delivery, and absolutely zero guarantee that it would work in any way. 
That would suck.
A new approach to portfolios
 
A lot of successful freelancers and even consultancies have switched to something else. If you’re not paying attention to this change, you may soon be left behind.
Instead of just showing off past work, these consultants have focused on turning their service offering into a story and using past work only to support that story.
This new type of portfolio improves the clarity of what is being offered and why it’s valuable. Instead of a portfolio, their website’s look more like a store or product page. There’s a clear buy button (or next step) and prominent pricing.
Their portfolio becomes a product that’s for sale for people who want something similar.
They use customized forms, mailing-list auto responders, and systematized documents that cut down hand-holding and focus instead on delivering more value.
They seem to realize that their website will never get a ton of traffic, so they focus instead on catering to the small group of people that actually visit their website. They spend weeks studying their customer and writing copy that will paint a picture of what working together will look like.
They’ve put themselves into their clients shoes and don’t shy away from pricing. They simply charge what they are worth and what they’re comfortable with.
You can start doing this today. Here’s some examples of this approach:</p>

  <p>Workshop $49/month by Robert Williams A newsletter &amp; community delivering quality gigs to ambitious freelance designers and developers.
This is my productized service. I use my experience as a freelance consultant to help others find work. They pay me $49/month to track job boards and send only the qualified freelance opportunities, saving them 5–10 hours a week. They’re able to focus 100% on replying to leads instead of finding them and some report hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work from my leads in the first few months.</p>

  <p>Draft Revise $1,500/month by Nick Disabato Website conversion optimization.
Nick’s, an independent interaction designer from Chicago who now dedicates half of his time to a particular subset of clients. 
Instead of chasing the typical large project that most freelancers have their heart set on, he goes after dozens of tiny projects each month. In fact, about a dozen clients pay him a $1,500/month rate in exchange for simple A/B testing and implementation. Since he does so many of them, he’s able to systematize his work to the point where much of it is automated. 
Naturally, a lot of these small projects evolve into larger ones but only after Nick has amazed clients with his work and decided it’s a mutual fit. His website is truly amazing in how it markets his service.</p>

  <p>User Onboarding Expert Review by Samuel Hulick Recommendations and video chat with expert at user onboarding.
If you’re able to package your expertise into a beautifully written and actionable collection, do it. Samuel Hulick’s take on user onboarding is not only presented in his book, but also the free teardowns of popular web apps. He’s now added a custom teardown option you can buy for your own website. This is brilliant because he doesn’t need to show his portfolio, and yet he proves how much of an expert he is. Warning: comparing this to your standard-issue portfolio may cause depression.</p>

  <p>Rapid Advice $1000 per page by Jakub Linowski A conceptual sketch with recommended changes to your user interface focused on raising your conversion rate.
For $1,000 you can pick Linowski Interaction Design’s collective (people behind goodui.org) brain for one page on your website. The entire package includes feedback, a sketch, consultation, and additional variations.</p>

  <p>Website Rescues $2,480 per website by Kurt Elster Implementation and design of 40-some best practices to make your website generate more revenue.</p>

  <p>Consults $400/livechat by Paul Jarvis</p>

  <p>Typography for Lawyers by Matthew Butterick A collection of best practices, fonts, and books on typography for lawyers. 
You wouldn’t immediately think that a website created to help attorneys design their documents better would be a huge money making machine, but Matthew Butterick has been able to do just that with his passion for typography.
This awesome website highlights a great principle that more people should listen to: use highly specialized knowledge to your advantage. The site doesn’t try to just be the best at everything instead it’s the best resource on one thing. It is centered around the tiny subject of typography for lawyers. Matthew has been able to create premium fonts, books and detailed articles.
The best part is that the content is so valuable, it would literally take years of study (or hiring an expensive designer) to get half of what’s available on his site for free. This is how you kill it with a productized service.</p>

  <p>Example of using a small productized service as a stepping stone to large projects: WP Curve
WP Curve takes the headache out of managing a WordPress site with “Wordpress support and small jobs” for only $64/month.
Let’s face it the price alone takes away all the risk to most clients so there’s really no reason not to sign up if you need WordPress support. Not only is WP Curve able to offer this service as an up sell to current clients (like a mini-retainer) but they’re now the “go-to” WordPress expert for a new pool of clients that would’ve never trusted them before. It’s a great foot in the door to large projects.</p>

  <p>Example of taking something your current client’s request a lot and turning it into a simple product: Be Stunning
Be Stunning is a brilliantly simple example. It boils down to: for $50/month you can decrease churn and implement a SaaS best-practice. They send dunning emails when a charge is declined, which give the user a grace period to update their information. That’s it. I told you it was simple.</p>

  <p>Example of using a newsletter to qualify clients: Get Production Ready
Luca Mearelli, a full stack freelance developer and dev-op zeroes in on a common pain for clients. Instead of trying to present every selling point to his clients in person, he’s created a newsletter auto responder that does the qualifying.</p>

  <p>Example of a product any freelancer or consultancy can offer today: WP Theory
If you want to reassure a prospective client who’s been burned by long deadlines and price increases in the past, here’s how you do it. WP Theory will launch your website IN A DAY.</p>

  <p>The $1,000/hr consulting product: Copyhackers Website Review
Joanne from Copy Hackers has written ebooks that help you write your own website… but she also offers her customized insights in the form of another product.
A Copy Hackers Website Review will get you Joanna’s review of your web copy. She creates and sends you: a 60-minute video review of the most prominent pages on your site (or of your one-pager site) along with other customized suggestions for your website.
It’s a great value for clients because they get a CRO copywriter without the large formal contract or expense of a full engagement.</p>

  <p>Example of white labeling a productized service: Kudo
If you suck at adwords you can outsource the entire thing to a fully-managed service called Kudo. Not only does Kudo offer this service to clients, they offer it as a white-label service to other agencies.</p>

  <p>Example of a retainer-like service: My content sherpa
Philip Morgan takes a well established business model, a retainer, and markets it as a product. You get your business’s messaging completely rewritten and a content schedule outlined specifically for your business. An engagement like this would usually mean creating a custom estimate but here it’s been boiled down into a templated offering. This makes it so much simpler for all parties.
 
 </p>

  <p>Example of a world-class consultant’s approach to productized consulting: Neil Patel
Neil Patel is seen as the authority on SEO because of the massive amount of great content he creates. Surely someone of this status doesn’t have to market his consulting business, right? Actually, his brilliant consulting website is one of the best, most focused examples I’ve ever seen.
Neil’s website works tirelessly to make cold leads become clients. The headlines on his site are great examples of baking benefits into your writing.</p>

  <p>Example of making an abstract service and benefit (creative direction) a product: Correlation
How do you turn something as abstract as “creative direction” into a templated service?
You wrap it in tangible valuable deliverables. Correlation, a service by Jane Portman, is a great example. Every month starts with a skype consultation, written report, and visuals you can use immediately.</p>

  <p>The “add me to your team for a month” product: Clarity Box
This is a really interesting service by Claire Lew where she interviews each person in your company and presents an in-depth panoramic view of how everyone feels. You pay for one-hour interviews of each employee, and a debrief afterwards. By the end you have an honest, and thoughtful perspective on how to improve your company.</p>

  <p>Example of a big agency making small, fast websites: Impress
Design agency Digital Telepathy offers smart-websites for $7.5k and a 2-week turn around. They’ve not only templated the timeline and budget, but the actual features they design into each website.
 </p>

  <p>Example of “my writing is awesome, pay me for it” approach – Grounded &amp; Steadfast
Web developer Chris Bowler offers a simple (and optional) $1.99/month subscription of his blog content. Simple but interesting.</p>

  <p>The freelancer seven-day free trial: Eric Davis
Here’s another example of using mailing list to qualify and educate client’s before taking them on.

What these all-stars have in common
Look at these examples. They are almost completely made up of text, not portfolio pictures. So why are all of these approaches working so well?
The easy answer is that they focus on removing potential barriers clients may have.
Not one mentions a portfolio, instead they focus on making you feel like working with them is a no-brainer.
No the work doesn’t speak for itself, so before you can deliver more value to our clients with awesome work you need to GET CLIENTS. Believe it or not that’s a pretty crucial step.
In a nutshell, this approach is about guiding the uninitiated stranger all the way to the life-long dream-client. While this won’t make your work any better, it sure as hell will make your potential client’s think it’s better — and that perception will certainly make more people become paying client’s.</p>

  <p>Actionable steps to get your service moving in this direction
You want to automate and systematize your offering.
This doesn’t mean creating a long sales page like the one above. Instead focus on a implementing the following:
1. Examine a new client’s typical journey.
 
This means inspecting each step a client had to go through to a) find you, b) contact you, c) like you, and d) hire you. What are those steps for you?
Do they find you on dribbble, then email you? Do they use a form on your website? Do you email them first? What happens next?
Write down every interaction that happens in the typical order they happen. Examine this process all the way until you actually begin work on a project (bonus points if you go beyond). You’ll typically find there’s 10–15 steps for onboarding a client.
Once you’re done, here’s what your process may look like:
	1.	Client sees you on dribbble. 
	2.	They go to your website.
	3.	They visit your ‘contact’ page and copy your email address.
	4.	They go to their email hit ‘compose’ and paste your email address into the recipient field.
	5.	They send you some brief details about the project, and ask you if you’re interested.
	6.	You reply with a few questions about the project.They reply with answers to your questions.
	7.	If it seems like a fit, you suggest a meeting over skype.
	8.	They’ll accept your skype invitation, and ask you to pick a time.
	9.	You give a day and time that works.If that day doesn’t work for the client, you send over a new one.
	10.	Once you go over the project on skype, you outline a proposal or scope for the project and define deliverables.
	11.	The client will go over what you put together and make changes.
	12.	Barring any hidden surprises, you agree to a scope of work / proposal.
	13.	You receive payment for the agreed amount.
	14.	You have a kick-off meeting about the project and the scope of work expands a bit (which you don’t charge extra for, sadly).
	15.	As You begin work on the project, you may have a few last minute questions before you can start.
	16.	The client might have some questions about working with you, that he/she was too afraid to ask during the courting process. What’s your name again? Your start work on deliverables.
Now this isn’t the exact process for everyone, but I’m guessing a lot of these steps are familiar to you. Kinda messy, no?
In fact a lot of the steps could be eliminated completely, and still result in an improved client experience.
2. Answer questions before they’re asked. 
 
Make it easy to get started: instead of waiting until the client contacts you to send over questions you need answered, add a form to your website with these questions built-in. Direct any inquiries that don’t come in via your website to that form, so that all clients know there’s an established process to follow when working with you. That’s what a lot of the examples above are doing, each in their own way; answering common questions potential clients have before they even ask them.
3. Send a welcome packet that answers common questions and sets the expectation of what it’s like working together:
There’s bound to be questions a client doesn’t realize they have until you begin working together. Some of these may seem too awkward to ask (“what’s your name again?”).
Send over a welcome package with answers to frequently asked questions. Include a bit about yourself, what you specialize in, what you don’t do, how often you report to clients, what software/tools you’ll use, how/when you receive payments, how you present work, how you expect feedback to be delivered, your availability, and other questions people may have. It will start your relationship off on the right foot, and it’s also really impressive to send this over.
Send over this package as part of the sales process. Preferably before you setup a skype call, that way the client gets an inside look at working with you and can decide whether you are going to be the right person for the job before you actually spend any time trying to land the project.
4. Qualify prospects before investing your time in the project:
Now that you have the answers coming in from your custom-built form, and have sent over a welcome package, you have a highly-qualified client. Now the fun starts.
Once you land the client it’s awesome to send the prospective/new client a thoughtful gift. It doesn’t have to be expensive, just something simple that shows you are thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile. It’s surprising how a $10.00 book can turn a casual acquaintance into a true champion. Bonus points if you’ve written the book you’re sending over.
A big benefit to productizing your consulting service is predictable revenue. It allows you to move away from selling units of your time. It also serves as a good introductory project for new clients because it’s easy to swallow and takes all risk away from them. If you do it right it’s all about your client. They get to relax by and shop for a finished, definable, outcome in comfort.
By no longer trying to get crazy amounts of traffic, you’re making people who are really interested in your service offering come to you.
So when they do, make sure your website is focused on them.</p>
