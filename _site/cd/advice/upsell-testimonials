    <p>I’ve used this with clients before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[NAME]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust is vital to my business but new clients who don’t know me have to take a risk at first. Testimonials from past clients can help remove that risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you mind writing (or recording) a short testimonial about [[the project or one aspect on the project you need a testimonial about]]. Even something short and simple is useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shared by Workshop member Eric Davis</p>

<hr />

<p>When I’m coming close to the end of a project, I’ll simply send an email like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh and by the way, I’m thinking of doing a case study about ProjectName on my website, with your permission? I would also love to include a testimonial from you about my work with :CompanyName: – something like this would be perfect:
“Buying Robert’s design services to create a website that is measurably adept at getting more customers is a guaranteed investment.
:ClientName: – Founder”
In fact, if you’re busy at the moment, I can use that quote for now. Either way, let me know, thank you!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This works for me 99% of the time, because all a busy client has to say is “yea sure” and bam, the work is done.</p>

<p>(BTW, this is the same way I approach all of my emails to clients during the project as well. I do all the work for my client, and just give them options or a yes or no question they can choose between.)</p>

<p>After all, my job is to do this project FOR my client – and to lay everything out for them perfectly in order to minimize their time commitment. NOT give them more work by having to manage me.</p>

<p>Once I get a testimonial (which is basically a referral to the whole world), I’ll go in and ask directly for a referral.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey :ClientName:, Thanks for the testimonial this was an awesome project.
I’d like to continue working with you – I have a few ideas for what we can do in the next few weeks to add to this project and make it even more successful.
I’ll send those over soon, but for now if you know of anyone who would beneﬁt from a similar service, I would love it if you could send me their email and I’ll let them know that you were thinking this might be right for them, and answer any questions they have about how your project worked out (I’ll CC you on the email)!
Sound good?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again this approach takes all the hard work away by doing it for them. They simple email you who they have in mind, and you take care of the rest.</p>
