    <p>Layered Tech Redesign</p>

<p>Tara,</p>

<p>So I’m pretty excited right now. The more I’ve dug through Layered Tech the more I’m finding how perfectly this project lines up with our abilities and values. It’s looking like the perfect project. I’ve got a few questions but I’ll lay out what I do know and we can discuss further once you’ve looked over this information.</p>

<p>Project Goal</p>

<p>Redesign current content around a framework of modern, professional, trust and approachability. Dominate the online security and compliance industry.</p>

<p>Project Content Details</p>

<p>Homepage</p>

<p>The main focus of the redesign
Nucleused around concise education on the features and benefits of Layered Tech
Static Content Pages</p>

<p>Supplementary pages organized within a sensical directory structure for convenient discovery at the appropriate times
Dynamic Content Pages</p>

<p>Blog
Newsroom
Events
Media Center
Forms</p>

<p>Quote form
Contact form
Required Non Design Elements</p>

<p>Chat portal
Account portal
Tiny Anvil Pricing Breakdown</p>

<p>$2500 for the home page, site architecture and style guide
$150 for each additional static page
$1500 for the first dynamic content page
$800 for each additional dynamic content page
$500 for the first form
$300 for each additional form
So theoretically let’s say the project goes something like this..</p>

<p>Let’s get started with a phenomenal homepage. This gets you started in the right direction with a style guide, the overall feel of the site and its basic layout structure. $2500</p>

<p>Now let’s say we narrow the current 70+ pages down to a more reasonable 30. (30 * 150 = $4500)</p>

<p>We’re going to need at least two forms for this site. The request a quote form and a more basic contact form. (500 + 300 = $800)</p>

<p>Finally let’s assume we want to take all four dynamic content pages into this design as well. The blog, the news, the events and finally the media center. (1500 + 800 + 800 + 800 = $3900)</p>

<p>Adding that all up we arrive at an initial project quote of $11,700</p>

<p>As you can see this leaves the project scope and thus price in your hands. Perhaps you’d like to skip the blog, add some pages, or even just have us start the project with the homepage and style direction and then hand that off to some other team. It’s totally up to you.</p>

<p>Once we arrive at the project scope and content we can work out a reasonable timeline. Just as reference however, a project like the one mentioned above could be completed in 7 – 8 weeks depending on the response time from the client and any freelancers/agencies we have to subcontract work out to.</p>

<p>This does not include any Quartz or SVG animations, video or extra interactive work that our team is not equipped to handle. I can however make recommendations for filling these seats which you could then reach out to and direct back to us for creative direction in applying their skills to the project.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the final deliverable will not be a design prototype but rather a fully functional responsive website solution with a control panel ready to be hosted on your server and put to use immediately.</p>

<p>What we do is not the cheapest option but it is done with excellence. We take great pride in our code quality and client relationships. I have no doubt in my mind that together we could create something that would place Layered Tech head and shoulders above the rest of a very competitive industry.</p>

<p>– Tyler</p>
