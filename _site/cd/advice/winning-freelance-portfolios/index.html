    <p>You usually have a portfolio to get work.</p>

<p>(It’s true, sometimes a freelancer or consultancy use their for other reasons, and it’s important to make that distinction clear. This email is for people who want to get work from their site.)</p>

<p>In order to get work from your portfolio or website, you need to know what a prospective client wants when they come to your site. And that’s one thing; to see if you can handle their upcoming project.</p>

<p>The typical portfolio you’ll see is a combination of large attractive glamour shots, short paragraphs, and list of details like; client, date, url or a button linking to the live site.This makes sense. You want to see my experience, well look at what I made! As a result, a freelancer tends to work on their portfolio when they’re looking for work or just getting started.</p>

<p>A very common complaint freelancers have is that these websites don’t get enough traffic.</p>

<p>After all, they want to tinker, test, and improve the site, but without first getting big amounts of traffic, they don’t know what to improve.</p>

<p>But these websites will never get much traffic, no matter what you do, so you’re kidding yourself by aiming for it.</p>

<p>Sure it’s tempting to invest large amounts of time and effort to getting more visitors, but even if you did achieve this goal, it’s really a waste of time. After all, you don’t have thousands (or even hundreds) of clients, meaning an extremely tiny percentage of people even qualify as a potential client. With these odds, it’s ridiculous to try a volume strategy. You need to focus on effectiveness.</p>

<p>Freelancer sites don’t get much traffic because no one looks at portfolios more than once or MAYBE twice if it’s really awesome.</p>

<p>There’s simply not enough to hold our interest or be engaged by (plus they’re extremely time-consuming and laborious to build.)</p>

<p>If you were my client I’d advise against this low-ROI investment.</p>

<p>Yet, most freelancers spend tons of time crafting their site. Yes, I too was obsessed throughout college and upon graduating.</p>

<p>Few people ever really nail a portfolio. These are some of the rare great ones: http://draft.nu/, http://neilpatel.com/, http://www.analyticl.com/, http://ethercycle.com.</p>

<p>So what makes these great? They tell you a story. Sure they have awesome projects, but they don’t just let the work speak for itself. They tell you why it’s great, and why they’re great.</p>

<p>That’s what’s missing in the average freelancer’s portfolio. Anyone can have pretty pictures on a responsive grid - so what?</p>

<p>You have a downloadable pdf resume on your homepage? I’m not going to click on it.</p>

<p>You wrote a long blog article about your thoughts on gamification as it relates to pixel perfection in the flat design sphere. I’m sorry but no one is going to read it, or at least no one that will be paying you money in the near future.</p>

<p>But it’s ok.</p>

<p>You don’t need tons of people flocking to your website every day to get clients and make money.</p>

<p>Hell, you don’t even need a freelance website to make money as a freelancer.</p>

<p>All you need is a handful of interested prospects coming to you form your site, and to get this, you only need a few hundred visitors per week.</p>

<p>That’s easily attainable by simple, basic, marketing in just a couple weeks. (Reply to this email for more info on how to do this).</p>

<p>Out of those one hundred weekly visitors, you should average 1 or 2 solid inquiries, that is if your freelance site is working as it should.</p>

<p>To get that many clicks to your site you don’t have to write billion-word blog posts, you don’t need to market yourself like mr. oxy-clean, and you don’t have to post to twitter with the frequency of a blooming teenage bieber freak.</p>

<p>You just need be yourself and talk about interesting stuff wherever you happen to be online. Also make sure to link to your site in your profile, that might help.</p>

<p>By no longer trying to get crazy amounts of traffic, you’re making people who are really interested in your service offering come to you. So when they do, make sure you put the focus on them.</p>

<p>Here’s a few ideas on how to do that.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a headline that is SPECIALIZED on one type of project, client, and outcome - not general ‘I do everything for everybody’.</li>
  <li>Talk about the benefits of working with you instead of just highlighting portfolio beauty.</li>
  <li>Have a custom call to action and contact form on your homepage to make it easy to people to send you an inquiry.</li>
  <li>If possible keep your entire site to one page.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four things will increase your conversion on your portfolio site, and help you find clients. It’s not about the amount of traffic you get when you’re a freelancer, it’s about getting direct.</p>
