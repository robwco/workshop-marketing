  <article class="post-content">
    <p>On Friday, I followed emailed this lead on: http://www.wphired.com/wordpress-jobs/word-press-expert/</p>

<p>I emailed her my standard cold email with example projects and closing with the ask: “It’s okay to say no but if you do see a fit, I’d like to discuss the details of your project next week. I have time for a call Monday afternoon, does that work for you? If not, then the follow morning also works.”</p>

<p>The immediate reply I got was, “Yes…. You sound very expensive?” which is really confusing because I didn’t mention prices at all, I just gave three example projects. So basically she’s saying, “Oh, I see you’re experienced, so obviously you’re expensive.” Not cool.</p>

<p>Since I don’t want she considers expensive, I explain, “With no minimum commitments, I offer ongoing support at $174/hour. Changing content, adding features, or running updates is as easy as sending us an email. Most support requests are completed same day, often within an hour.”</p>

<p>Immediately she tried to neg me with, “Sorry you are overpriced for the market.” after admitting I seemed expensive/intimidating/experienced. This super annoyed me. The truth is I’m more than she’s willing to pay, and she has no idea how fast I do or don’t work.</p>

<p>I know I should have walked away at this point, but it’s good practice, so I replied again, “I appreciate your candor. If I lowered my rates, I wouldn’t be able to offer the talent, resources, and service that result in satisfied clients and winning projects.”</p>

<p>She replied again with this red flag throwdown: “Perhaps you do not understand what I need. I do the copy I do the seo…You just put together the look and feel. I could not charge for my work if you charged that much for yours. I will call you.” and she did call me but I didn’t answer because I didn’t want to work with her. I just wanted to a good lesson in beating price objections.</p>
