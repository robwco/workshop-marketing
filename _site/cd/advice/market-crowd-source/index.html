    <p>I caution you to maybe think them through a bit more, and word them in more of a positive tone before sending on to your client.</p>

<p>For instance, your last point could be rephrased as:
“Working with Erik will provide you with guaranteed custom solutions to fit your exact needs. UX, UI, and visual elements created specifically for you, instead of being pulled from a well of stock elements designed to cater to the largest number of applications possible.”</p>

<p>Start with your positive, and reinforce with the 99d negative.</p>

<p>I think reinforcing the “tailor-made” qualities of your work vs. the “off the rack” mediocrity of options like 99d will be your strongest argument.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to reinforce that projects rarely fit into buckets like those shown on the 99d site, and there is very consistently unforeseen scope creep to projects. You will be much easier to adjust arrangements and contracts with than an e-design firm.</p>

<p>Lastly, remind them that it’s not just about getting the work done. It’s about forming a relationship for solving future problems. You’re hear to make their lives easier, and you’d love to offer continuing, quick-access support for their needs. (GET MORE WORK!!)</p>

<p>From my POV you have a value problem — either the client does see the full value of you or doesn’t understand the value they won’t receive with 99 Designs… I do programming so I usually tell the client good luck and I’ll do my best to give them a good price when the chop-shop option comes up short (you wouldn’t buy products on CL so why would you buy something to run your business on CL??)</p>

<p>The solution they’re looking for isn’t about the best price, it’s about creating the greatest value for the client. You can do that; 99D cannot. As Corey pointed out, your challenge is explaining the USP of Erik and how those clown can’t come close to matching you. If you sound confident and smile while you’re on the phone (people seem forget that one) I am sure they’ll get it. Remember, if they 100% knew what they were doing they wouldn’t be looking for someone — you have to guide them to the Erik solution. You’re simply reinforcing the value that they’re not able to measure :)</p>

<p>Based on my experience, if a client doesn’t understand the difference between working with a professional and going to a site like 99Designs, it is better to just leave, because that client will cause further headache to you.</p>

<p>But if you want to convince them, tell them that NO designer will do their best when working on a site like 99D. No one will put their best effort and energy into a deal that is not guaranteed to pay.</p>

<p>They will probably end up getting something that is based on a design they made for someone else previously.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t try competing with bullet points.</p>

<p>Instead be real.</p>

<p>Be blunt upfront and tell them yes they are going to pay more with you. A lot more. Link them to non-biased informative articles: http://blog.folyo.me/the-5-dollar-logo/ Tell them you won’t blame them if they go the cheap route but that you also think it’s the wrong choice for their business. In fact, invite them to try the cheap solution first and see for themselves the type of results it gets then come to you.</p>

<p>Tell them this might help them answer their questions because they’ll ask why their design isn’t as good as someone who used a ‘real designer or design agency’ they will start to unravel the fact that design provides much more then a graphical element - it provides problem solving and strategy. The person who bought a cheap design on a crowd-source website will begin to realize that their design is extemely valuable to their business and merits large investment. Thus becoming a more well-rounded client who appreciates the value of design.</p>

<p>And the fact that if they want to get this high quality design, they will need to pay an appropriate price to what the value provides.</p>

<p>Saying that a $100 logo is taking work away from you is saying your logos are worth $100.</p>

<p>Compete based on the value you provide, not price.</p>
