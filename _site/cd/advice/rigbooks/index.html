<h1>Rigbooks Design Proposal</h1>

<p>Hey Jason! This page contains a mixture of first-thoughts, recommendations, and quick deep-dives into the onboarding and design process for helping on your marketing. Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<h3>Recommended services that will encompass entire marketing site:</h3>

<div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #f1f1f1; width: 760px; margin: 2em auto; padding: 3em 2em;">
<p style="margin: 0 auto -1em;"><label>Recommended service one:</label></p>
<h3>Implementing good typography (site currently uses Helvetica, styled as an afterthought).</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typography matters because it helps conserve the most valuable resource you have as a writer — reader attention.</li>
<li>Good typography can help your reader devote less attention to the mechanics of reading and more attention to your message.</li>
<li>Conversely, bad typogra­phy can distract your reader and undermine your message.</li>
<li>Rigbooks.com features typography that’s been tacked on as an afterthought, not carefully considered.</li>
<li>The type on the page is currently not reinforcing the meaning of the text.</li>
<li>With how few pages are on the site, basic typographic changes can be made to ensure every page has thoughtfully designed text.</li>
<li>This will allow users to spend less time reading and yet understand you better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Particularly on your sales pages and blog posts, text and images will be re-designed to persuade and present a more sophisticated and consistent company design. The following screenshot shows a particularly poor reading experience, commonly referred to "the wall of text".
</p>
	<center>
	&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/type.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 560px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em auto;") %&gt;
	</center>
	
</div>

<div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #f1f1f1; width: 760px; margin: 2em auto; padding: 3em 2em;">
<p style="margin: 0 auto -1em;"><label>Recommended service two:</label></p>
<h3>Revise microcopy and provide a second pair of eyes for every word on your site.</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are some places where we can make quick wins by re-thinking what is said in small, but critical places. Are FAQs worded confusingly? Does the the instruction on each step of the sign up process make sense?</li>
<li>I found a lot of areas where we could improve this drastically (some not even mentioned in this report).</li>
<li>This will increase usability and conversions, decrease support requests and strengthen the all around thoughtfulness of the product.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Example:</strong> When I signed up I entered my email, but now when I arrive at the sign in form it asks for username - this should be kept consistent to not confuse the user.
</p>
	<center>
	&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/signup.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 660px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em auto;") %&gt;
	</center>
</div>

<div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #f1f1f1; width: 760px; margin: 2em auto; padding: 3em 2em;">
<p style="margin: 0 auto -1em;"><label>Recommended service three:</label></p>
<h3>Redesign navigation and funnel on the site to remove confusion about finding what you need on the site.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bouncing between the different package sales pages is too hard. For example, if I’m on the <strong>Leased O/O sales page</strong> and want to get to learn more about the <strong>Small Fleet package</strong> I have to go to the homepage and click on that plan. If I instead go to pricing and click Small fleet, I get taken to a sign up page prematurely.</li>
<li>The sign up pages for every plan all look the same which is confusing. What if I change my mind once I’m on this page? Would I know there was even a difference between the two pages?</li>
<li>Links in footer are a complete after thought and should be looked at again.</li>
<li>In particular, the social media links in this section are useless because they link to inactive accounts. If a potential customer sees this, they may question whether the company is still running.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The links in the <strong>"About"</strong> section of the footer area don’t really make sense because they aren’t really linking to any pages which give you background info about the company. It’s better to rename this area.
	<center>
	&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/about.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em auto;") %&gt;
	</center>
	
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Recommendations for Blog</h2>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/blog.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<ul>
<li>Somethings aren't clear when you arrive on this page: what’s the first thing I should do to get started? why can’t I sign up to a newsletter or drip campaign to learn about what bookkeeping will do for my trucking business?</li>
<li>The title <strong>“The Blog”</strong> doesn’t tell me anything, and does a poor job of explaining why I’ll get something out of this content.</li>
<li>Can’t find where or even whether your blog offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc. which I may be looking for besides the most recent post.</li>
<li>It’s also almost impossible to find the “page 2” of the blog. The <strong>“newer”</strong> and <strong>“older”</strong> links are extremely hard to find.</li>
<li>There’s no apparent links to past articles.</li>
<li>There’s also nowhere to sign up to get updates to the blog via email.</li>
<li>I don’t know where one blog post ends and another begins.</li>
<li>It’s also really hard to navigate. If I was looking for something specific I wouldn’t know where to look. (Also no search bar.)</li>
<li><strong>The formatting on the blog posts is extremely hard to read. The content is basically rendered useless because of the styling.</strong>

<ul>
<li>The line-height is too tight and the font size is a little small, making reading a long article unpleasant.</li>
<li>The subheads are overly large and make me think they’re the beginning of a new article.</li>
<li>Some articles have completely unique styling which makes them look odd as a cohesive group of content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So much of the content is hidden. I wouldn’t be able to find most of it if I was an average user. You need to put your best articles in the sidebar in a <strong>“Start Here”</strong> section.</li>
<li>Individual blog posts should have <strong>”You much also enjoy…”</strong> sections where they pitch other blogs in the same category.</li>
<li><em>Sidenote about Rigbooks pages link in the <strong>”Friends”</strong> section: page is poorly designed and gives the impression of a site that’s not being taken care of anymore.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations for Pricing page</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/pricing.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>Differences in packages isn’t clear.</li>
<li>Some terms are vague and there’s too much text on the page (especially the package descriptions) which could be removed to provide more clarity and highlight what the differences <strong>are</strong>.</li>
<li>It also wasn’t clear to me how many trucks I get on each plan, that should be made more obvious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations for Sign up page</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/signup-1.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s not immediately clear what plan you’re signing up for when you get to this screen. The only hint is the url.</li>
<li>This page also doesn’t do a great job of up-selling other plans or even the assuring the user about the terms of signing up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations for First Run</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/ready.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>The first thing you see; the <strong>“Account is ready”</strong> screen, displays an overwhelming amount of information.</li>
<li>There’s no reason the information on this page could not be split over multiple steps and pages. The rest of this critique is going to assume each following step has already been split into multiple parts.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/ready-2.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<h3>Your Account is ready</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>“Your Account is Ready!”</strong> is a useless phrase because it gives me almost no information yet takes up most of the screen.</li>
<li><strong>“Your free 30 day trial of Rigbooks begins today. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel anytime. You will not be billed until the trial period is over.”</strong> Is actually a much better thing to emphasize and give importance to because it informs me of 3 things that are very re-assuring in feeling safe with this trial.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/trucks.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<h3>Enter Truck Information</h3>

<ul>
<li>Again the typography is hurting the users ability to focus and understand instruction. Based on the tiny size of the text which tells me what to do, there’s almost no hint for a user who's in a hurry.</li>
<li>For example: instead of just <strong>“Trucks”</strong> why not label this step <strong>“Add your trucks”</strong>?</li>
<li>Also, is all of this information crucial? Could you just use make and model? Do all customers have reference / truck number handy at all times? If not this could be a potential stumbling block for some people which gets them away from actually using and exploring the app at a crucial early stage.</li>
<li>Is there any reason this information couldn’t be captured at a later date?</li>
<li>What if I realize I need more than one truck at this point? Why can’t I upgrade?</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&lt;center&gt; &lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/expenses.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;/center&gt;</p>

<h3>Your Expense Categories</h3>

<ul>
<li>Again the instruction here is vague. Instead of <strong>“Expense Categories”</strong> I’d suggest something more instructive like <strong>“Uncheck the expenses you don’t want to keep track of”</strong>.</li>
<li>The copy in the “Additional Expense Categories” section is vague and overly-complicated. It could be shortened to two sentences: <strong>“Add categories not listed above”</strong> and <strong>“You can easily add new categories later.”</strong></li>
</ul>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/revenue.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h3>Your Revenue Categories</h3>

<ul>
<li>See notes for expense categories</li>
</ul>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/begin.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h3>Begin using Rigbooks</h3>

<ul>
<li>I’m not a fan of having these questions here. It breaks the flow of the user and they suddenly have to think about why they signed up and how they heard of you when really you want them using your app as quickly as possible. This adds an unnecessary barrier to them using the app.</li>
<li>Try sending these questions in an email a few minutes / hours after sign up. You'll most likely get better responses because they're not in a hurry to get to the app.</li>
<li>The skip button makes me wonder: could I have skipped this entire page? Was any of this required or necessary? If not, why was it the first step? Why was it here in the first place? Why not show me something else that was more crucial?</li>
</ul>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/dashboard.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h2>Dashboard page</h2>

<ul>
<li>This page has some classic blank-slate usability concerns.</li>
<li>It fails to set expectations and you never get a second chance.</li>
<li>There’s no doubt this page would look and work great when it’s flush with data, but the problem is there’s none here.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the customer decides if an application is worthy at this blank slate stage — the stage when there’s the least amount of information, design, and content on which to judge the overall usefulness of the application. When you fail to design an adequate blank slate, people don’t know what they are missing because everything is missing.</li>

<li><strong>Some quick ideas:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Use this page as an opportunity to insert quick tutorials and help blurbs.</li>
<li>Give a sample screenshot of the page populated with data so people know what to expect (and why they should stick around).</li>
<li>Explain how to get started, what the screen will eventually look like, etc.</li>
<li>Answer key questions that first-time viewers will ask: What is this page? What do I do now? How will this screen look once it’s full?</li>
<li>Set expectations and help reduce frustration, intimidation, and overall confusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First impressions are crucial. If you fail to design a thoughtful blank slate, you’ll create a negative (and false) impression of your application or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to stop the app usability design review here because this is about where the onboarding stops. But a lot of what’s been mentioned up to this point can also be applied through out the application in the future.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for the Homepage</h2>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/home.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h3>Headline - "Online Bookkeeping Software for Truckers"</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is this the best way to describe the service for truckers?

<ul>
<li>Isn’t including the term “Online” redundant/implied?</li>
<li>Do truckers like / use the term “software”?</li>
<li>I’d look at the headline on <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/">You Need a Budget's homepage</a> as a comparison.</li>
<li>Does YNAB's headline describe their product as “Online budgeting software”? No. They lead with "Gain Total Control of Your Money". Nobody wants software, they want a problem solved, they want an outcome. I'd lead with that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/quote.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h3>Quotes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>"I’ll never go back to using spreadsheets to keep track of my books.”</strong> Seems like a much stronger statement than anything prominently featured in your headline area but it’s hidden on the homepage</li>
</ul>

<center>
&lt;%= image_tag("rigbooks/benefits.png", :style =&gt; "max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; border: 1px solid #2996bf; margin: 2em 0;") %&gt;
</center>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>Honestly, these benefits would work a lot better on the sign up page as re-assurance to set expectations. That’s when I’ll be wondering if there’s contracts, and care most about a satisfaction guarantee. However, on the homepage it’s premature. I don’t even know what your app does yet so whether it works on every device is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content"><hr /></div>

<h3>Additional recommendations for Tyler or whoever is working on content marketing:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>With emphasis in navigation, typography, and usability, the re-design of the marketing website and blog would really compliment additional content marketing:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Creating a lead-gen or a free rig books guide ie. “this is exactly how you’d use the software for your business” and capturing as many prospects as possible with it.</strong> That way we can pin the blog/resource center around this lead-gen. We could even create the lead-gen by packaging existing blog content into something valuable like “The complete Trucking IFTA guide”. The only real goal that adding content to the blog should have is getting people signed up to a mailing list where Jason can sell them on Rigbooks over time. Especially since traffic is pretty low, capturing the most prospects possible is more important.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Creating a Drip email campaign which sends helpful information, builds trust and sells users on the Rigbooks.</strong> Once Rigbooks start collecting email addresses, the next step is to write a drip campaign to convert as many people as possible. Speaking from my experience with Workshop, this is one of the most important things I’ve done because it automated the selling process so much, it’s really been invaluable for me. 
</p></li>
</ol>


<div class="content"><hr /></div>

<h2>So, to summarize...</h2>

<p> Now that I took a deeper look at the site, I think the copywriting and design of the marketing site and first-run of the app should be enough work to provide major usability quick wins for us. I’ll be honest if I was still consulting, everything mentioned above would typically cost in the low five figures, however I consider it a fair trade for the work you’ve quoted me for the middle option of the Workshop development project.</p>

<p>To move forward I can jump into some of the front-end code changes as soon as you give the green light!</p>

<p>Cheers, Robert</p>

<p>Can't wait to get started, this is going to be awesome!</p>
