    <p><span class="run-in"><span>W</span>hen clients ask for spec work</span> they are demonstrating their willingness to gamble on the success of their project while stating that they don’t value your work or the time it takes you to create it. The person asking for the spec work may not actually realize the problems involved in creating work on a speculative basis.</p>

<h3 id="its-a-teaching-moment">It’s a teaching moment.</h3>

<p>Reply to all requests for spec work with this simple email template:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have reviewed your request for proposal in detail, and I am confident that under the appropriate conditions we could deliver an exceptional new website for [Client Company]. Unfortunately, we are not at liberty to work on a speculative basis. Our working hours are carefully planned, and as such our time is reserved for our paying clients. More importantly from your standpoint, spec work is simply not conducive to quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our workflow process has been crafted over several years of practice, and optimized to ensure the best possible result for our clients. Our designs are highly strategic; working through the appropriate phases of discovery and blueprinting are integral to preparing an informed and effective design presentation. Your website is important, and its composition deserves adequate time and effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We stand by our reputation, the quality of work in our portfolio, and our flawless history of satisfied customers. If you would like to commission us to create the visual design for your website before you commit to hiring us for the remainder of the project, I would be happy to accommodate such an arrangement.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It politely educates the client, creates an opportunity for a legitimate working relationship, and includes just the right amount of shaming.</p>

<hr />

<p>I run into this problem often. Anything beyond the initial proposal that is work in furtherance of that project I tend to charge for. While I will happily come in and pitch ownership/leadership for free, anything that creates IP (database architecture, mockups, screen flow diagrams, use case diagrams, etc) I charge the daily or hourly rate for. In addition to not wasting my time it also makes it clear to the client that they will not be in a position to waste my time. I want my clients to know that I am the “real deal” and that I spend my afternoons working, not dreaming.</p>

<p>Since I moved to this policy my close rate on folks who request this kind of work has jumped to over 90% – when I was wasting time (and not charging money) I would close 1 deal in about 5.</p>

<p>Just my two cents – I would love to hear what others are doing.</p>
