  <h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Here’s how it works. You alone are responsible for your actions and the results of your freelance business, which depend on personal factors such as your skill, abilities, knowledge, connections, and financial situation, just to name a few.</p>

  <p>I offer no warranties or guarantees regarding results. When addressing financial matters, I’ve taken every effort to ensure I accurately represent the service and it’s ability to enhance your freelancing business.</p>

  <p>However, by purchasing this service, you accept and agree that you are fully responsible for your progress and results (and those results will obviously vary).</p>

  <p>Any statements outlined are my opinion and thus are not guarantees or promises of actual performance. And if you have a question, ask it.</p>

  <h2 id="money-back-guarantee-refund-policy">100% Money-back Guarantee Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>I offer a 100% money-back guarantee. If you’re not happy for any reason I want to hear about it and fix it by giving you your money back.</p>

  <p>However, I do not accept refunds until after your full 6 months have expired. Yes, this is the opposite of most 90-day refund windows. Instead I <em>want</em> you to get the full experience before you ask for your money back.</p>

  <p>It really takes time to build a pipeline so please, sign up, take the full 6 months to try the leads then let me know if you don’t think it’s worth it.</p>

  <p>I’m so sure that it is that I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is. I offer you 100% protection.</p>

  <h2 id="site-terms-of-use-modifications">Site Terms of Use Modifications</h2>
  <p>I may revise these terms of use at any time without notice. By using this web site you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
