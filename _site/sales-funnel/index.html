		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">How to build a profitable sales funnel</h1>
    <h3 id="first-off-what-is-a-sales-funnel">First off, what is a sales funnel?</h3>
<p>The process that every freelance project goes through to land you a paying client. This includes how you win and find work.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-most-sales-funnels-look-like">What do most sales funnels look like?</h3>
<p>Almost every freelancer’s sales funnel is identical. You find a client online or through referral and proceed with a disorganized, inconsistent courting process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 id="pre-inquiry">Pre-inquiry</h3>

    <p>This is where a client or freelancer find one another. This can happen in a variety of places, like your portfolio, a website, referral or job posting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="inquiry">Inquiry</h3>

    <p>This is usually an <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com" class="off-site">email</a> or <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls">phone call</a> made expressing interest in working together. Typically, this is inquiry is pretty short and simple, containing contact information and a little background on the project or freelancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="inquiry-review">Inquiry Review</h3>

    <p>The freelancer and client will each assess whatever information they’ve been given about working together, and if desired, schedule some sort of follow up meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="first-meeting">First Meeting</h3>

    <p>The freelancer and client meet over Skype, <a href="https://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls">phone call</a>, or in person to discuss the project. Both sides give a rough idea of what they’re looking for, and receive a solid understanding of what working together will look like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>

    <p>Usually you, the freelancer, will sit down to put together some sort of proposal that will put ink to paper about what is expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="proposal-review">Proposal Review</h3>

    <p>The client will receive your roadmap and possibly ask to refine/change it. This is usually a string of emails, questions, and back-and-forth about the project until most details are ironed out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="revised-proposal-if-asked-to-change-first-proposal">Revised Proposal (if asked to change first proposal):</h3>

    <p>The freelancer will either present or send over a revised proposal. This may include a contract and invoice, at which point the client will either accept, decline, or <a href="https://letsworkshop.com/freelancer-negotiation">negotiate</a> a lower rate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="the-actual-work">The actual work</h3>

    <p>This is when you will begin work on the project, usually starting by learning as much as possible about the project and company you’re working with. Once you have adequately researched the project, you’ll begin creating the deliverables you and the client agreed upon.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="how-can-i-improve-my-sales-funnel">How can I improve my sales funnel?</h4>
<p>In order to improve your sales funnel you must first identify what each step of the process looks like for you. Some freelancers might get most of their inquiries from referrals, others might use job boards.</p>

<p>Once you’ve identified how your sales funnel is unique, you can identify where the problems are, like at what step potential clients are dropping off. Here are some good questions to start:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>At what step are you deciding whether to take on a project?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a better point in the sales funnel to do this?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>At what step is a client’s decision to hire you made?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At what step do you want a client to make their decision?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>At what step do you think you’re ready to give a price quote?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever given a price before this step?</li>
      <li>If so, how can you ensure this doesn’t happen?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Are you putting too much importance on any one step? (hint: it’s step 8)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How can you eliminate as many steps as possible without losing clients?</strong></li>
</ol>
