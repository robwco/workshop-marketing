        <title>Are big client projects losing you money?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I won’t touch projects that have budgets smaller than $30,000. Anything lower is usually low-quality and unprofitable for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a statement I get periodically from freelancers who pay me to send them leads. I’m not sure why $30,000 is the magical number for quality and profit but apparently it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I really don’t get about this statement is that it’s usually coming from a freelancer, aka a one-person business, who’s overhead costs are essentially zero (yes I know you pay $20/month for project management software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple that with the fact that these people claim to be “desperate for work” and sometimes even in a dry spell and it’s even more confusing. Still most of these freelancers “won’t touch” a large portion of potential projects because initial budgets are too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this is outrageous. In what world are we living where a $5,000-$10,000 project is unprofitable for  one-person? Is the problem here really a dollar amount that’s too low, or is it that you don’t know how to make a project of any size profitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-problem-with-big-budgets&quot;&gt;The big problem with big budgets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure 5-figure projects look great at first. You’ve got a far away deadline and a big wad of cash. At the start, the possibilities seem endless. However, these big projects also end up hurting freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, the big price tag pushes hiring companies into thinking they own you. You’re simply more demanding when you’re paying more money and unless you’re actively pushing back on this, you’ll naturally give in to more client requests for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when you feel scope creep start to kick in. You feel pressure to say yes to features and other requests that you don’t truly believe should be implemented because hey you’re getting paid a small fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People naturally want more bang for their buck. When you finally deliver the work, there’s endless revisions. Deadlines come and go without actually shipping anything. Projects drag on and on. Each day carving both you and your client’s profitability away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why if you’re not able to make a $5,000 project profitable, you’re less likely to make a larger, more complicated project profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, what exactly about a larger amount of work is easier to scope out and turn a profit on? Larger projects are by definition harder to make profitable because there’s more work to… try make profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think freelancers should focus on making smaller projects more profitable before they move on to large ones. If you can make a 5,000 projects profitable for you and your clients, you can also make a 5-figure budget profitable for you and your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-you-delivering&quot;&gt;What are you delivering?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think everything you’re delivering on those big $30k+ projects is essential. However, have you really examined what exactly is bringing your costs up so high that you can only afford to take on 5-figure projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find most of your budget goes to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outsourcing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emailing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and Following up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you cut the bulk of these costs and replaced them with nothing? Would the client be worse off? If not, then you should do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will make your business more viable. It will make your client’s business more viable. It’ll give you less of a headache. You’ll be able to focus on things that actually matter instead of fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Won’t cutting these things make you less money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Everything listed above is also hard to quantify. That’s why it’s hard to scope a large project accurately. You might think these things all carry a high margin but I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if you really examined them, you’d find out they’re not that profitable for you either. The work that matters is what’s implemented. Do more of that and less of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productize the way you present stuff, ask for feedback, onboard your clients and more. Create a better experience for them by systemizing the way clients work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decide-what-matters&quot;&gt;Decide what matters.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can taking less money be a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quote from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/35lpsc/i_charge_30k60k_for_wordpress_websites_with_a/&quot;&gt;great reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; about a guy who’s charging $50,000 for simple Wordpress websites with nothing much to them. Nothing much except what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should customers care about brand? Yes. But should they care about it more than sales? 80% of businesses fail in the first year, and I’m guessing a big part of it is paying someone $50 an hour to make a 10 page website that generates a net zero result for their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great point. Yes the point of this reddit thread is that he charges even more than $30,000 dollars but what’s important is that he’s focusing on value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can accomplish the same results by focusing only on what matters you can charge more. You can also make all projects more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is figuring out what is valuable to client. To start limit your work to two things. Things that will either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make them more money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save them more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you find ways to work for less and still make it more profitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;present-it-as-a-package&quot;&gt;Present it as a package.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what some high-value consultants are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://landingpageinaday.com&quot;&gt;Jarrod Drysdale will create an extremely affordable landing page that converts for you in a day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://websiterescues.com&quot;&gt;Kurt Elster will makes your ecommerce site make more money than it does now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://draft.nu/revise/express/&quot;&gt;Nick Disabato will tear down your site’s usability for $600.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all world-class designers charging less then a few thousand dollars for a valuable service. These are services that are profitable for a business of any size. (Even freelancers could benefit from hiring them at this price.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is an interesting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever considered hiring a freelancer like you for $30,000? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s truly a great investment why aren’t you paying for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a B2B service provider, it’s also in your best interest to make sure your service provides a profit for your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to ask if the money you’re getting paid is a sound investment for the company who’s hiring you. By taking it are you really helping the company you’re being hired to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that kind of self-critical price analysis is what we should be doing with our service on a normal basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think dabbling in creating a service offering where you’re actually charging less is smart. Especially if it means you’re working with a company you can actually help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would allow you to say no to more projects. It would open you up to working with different types of businesses that could have never afforded you before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients you might actually enjoy working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-step-for-you&quot;&gt;Next step for you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s never been a better time to be a designer or developer. You’re in demand. You build websites and apps and things that are valuable. So valuable in fact, people will pay you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(While I do agree that some highly-specialized consultants shouldn’t work for less than $X0,000 – I don’t think that’s the case for 90% of people. Probably including you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you should always charge more. Of course you should double your rate today. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe the current pricing model for freelancing is not all it’s cracked up to be in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would you do if instead you had to make a $3k project profitable?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specifically, what would you have to cut out?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would it make sense to hire yourself? Could you afford it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why not? How will the type of project you usually get hired for not be profitable for you as a client?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you change that?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Before you update your portfolio again, read this</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It started fresh out of college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d spend a countless hours working on my portfolio. Constantly tweaking it, making sure it was just right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was making a nice salary, but I didn’t feel like my time was valued so I was on the look out for a new job. This worsened when new management was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, my new boss called me into his office to “chat,” and I distinctly remember thinking “God, I hope I get fired.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I even sat down, a man I had only known for 2 weeks took a deep breath and let me know I was getting let go. (This came only 2 months after receiving a raise for my ‘great performance with the company’ — go figure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was left with the same 3 options that everyone in this industry has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work for an advertising/design agency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work for another company or startup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start my own independent consultancy, full-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meditating on my options (and laying on the beach for a week) I came to the conclusion that I would try to make freelancing my full-time business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first 6 months I ended up making about $30k. That may not seem like a lot to you, but it was a huge liberation to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided to start my own business, my mind shifted — I began to look at everything I did as a strategic system for getting new clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I did this, I realized I needed to stand out. If I was going to reach clients more effectively than the average freelancer online, I needed to have a better strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I looked at all the freelance designer portfolios online — aka my competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most had great work, and they all looked pretty similar. Honestly, not too different from my own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the portfolios I came across had no copy, just pictures. If they did write something, it was usually something short and catchy like, “pixel perfection” or “less is more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to the conclusion that freelance designers were focusing on portraying a “cool” image that they wanted to see in themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had spent literally thousands of hours on my portfolio since graduating college and the thought of spending more time on it was not an option. Plus, I realized clients didn’t care about “cool”  they cared about ”professional” and “trustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I decided I didn’t need a portfolio website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that if a potential client wanted to see my work they had to ask me. (I even deleted my dribbble and twitter). This allowed me to keep track of every single person who wanted to see my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also forced me to put an emphasis on the words I used in my emails – and eventually things like meetings and proposals. It lead me to crafting an offer specifically designed for the people I wanted to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I sat down to write my first emails, I avoided broad terms other designers used to describe their work. A lot of my peers described their work to clients in generic terms like “I do great user interface design.” I decided to learn niche phrases to startup culture like “conversion rate optimization,” and “lead generation,” instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective things I did for my business during this time was focus on one thing: getting clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something that came easier for me because I ran a one person freelance business with a very clear goal — earn money by getting clients. It prioritized everything I did, because I was able to ask myself ‘is this directly helping me reach my goal?’ — at any point in my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus allowed all my energy and time to be dedicated on the most important thing to my business: making money. Almost as important, it allowed me to see what areas were a total waste of time. Things that weren’t directly helping me generate revenue were killed… this included; twitter, facebook, blogging, dribbble, reading emails etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came down to me contacting people directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things, like twitter, might work for some people, but it didn’t work for me. What worked was emailing people directly. I put together a script using the tailored offer that I crafted and sent it out to dozens of startups throughout the six months. I used one site in particular for over 15k of my revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there were other, less-prolific job boards like craigslist, authentic jobs, and others, but the main idea was that I was using the same specific script to send out to many people. It felt so much better than sitting on my laurels and just posting stuff on twitter or dribbble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped letting the success of my business depend on outside forces like others contacting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I was able to track where my efforts were getting the biggest return. I used excel to track leads. For example: every time I sent a new email, I would update the file for that particular lead source. If I heard back, I would again update the file. Soon I was able to see which of these job boards were responding with the highest frequency, and put all my effort there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also prepared for the future. Whenever a lead would email me back even if just to let me know they were going with another designer, I would put them in a new folder — a pool of past leads to follow up with in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pool quickly became my most valued source for new work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting and depending on my freelance business taught me that you can’t listen to what other people say will work for you. If you do what everyone says you should do, you’ll be doing a little bit of everything. Trying the latest shiny tactic couldn’t hurt could right? The truth is, it can hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a successful freelancer I needed to focus on one thing, getting more clients, not everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly updating my portfolio website, tweeting, and posting dribbble shots, might have felt like I was working on my freelance business, but in the end it was just a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now know approximately how many leads I have to email in order to get a new client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you? How confident would you be if you did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Let’s find out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why some consultants 3X a clients budget, while others get low-balled</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, 
On Friday, I got an email from a Workshop member containing this beautiful nugget in the PS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/badass.png&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was reassuring in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the only one who awkwardly closes a parenthesis with a smiley face and then just DGAF.
Workshop, when used correctly, provides ridiculous amounts of ROI in my clients pockets.
So I replied and soon we got to talking about how this freelancer has been able to get such great results in such a short time. I’d like to share with you what he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His consultancy does all the basics right (they don’t respond too many leads, they keep emails short, etc.), but one thing he mentioned, jumped out at me above all else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve taken the mentality that most of these potential clients don’t know how much to charge for the work, so they don’t really put a price that matches. One client, we’re billing 3x more than they thought it would cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a big win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times a freelancer will scoff at a client’s proposed budget, and say “this guys trying to rip me off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know because freelancers email me with the same complaint, EVEN about Workshop leads (and I know these are good leads because I personally comb through them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a slight difference in approach to yield huge results and (as the savvy consultant mentioned) 3x more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is advice I give to Workshop members all the time. The reality is most people (especially clients) simply aren’t technically trained in web design and development. They just do not know how much their project’s intricacies should cost so they give their best (read: low-ball) estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, I’m sure you wouldn’t know exactly how much a project should cost at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as a professional consultant, you’d probably be able to get a lot closer, and that’s why it’s your job to educate them about realistic pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t 100% of people with low budgets, there’s always a cheapskate in the bunch, but 95% of people aren’t simply trying to rip you off.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard at first, even counter-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of how subjective creative work is, you might think telling a client their budget is unrealistic is guaranteed to make you sound sleezy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s often the opposite result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say, “look I know I may not make a single cent on the project because of this, but I think you need to spend 2 times your budget,” it won’t make you sound sleezy, it will make you sound like you have the client’s best interest at heart (aka: you’re not afraid to say the truth, even if it means losing the project)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s get one thing straight: people love to be sold to, if they’re receiving value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being sold something awesome is not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling someone their budget is unrealistic forces you to justify that claim, and can make you talk in terms of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, is 32GB worth $300? Hell no. What if those 32GB carried your entire music collection in your pocket and came with an interface engineered for maximum funness? Why that’s a steal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m assuming you loved every bit of buying an ipod – even though you could’ve gotten a cheaper mp3 player – because you knew it would be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Apple spoke to you, the words they used, the commercials they ran, made you know they were on your side. You could just feel that they understood your music listening needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s take one of your clients as an example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you alert a client that what they’re looking for should actually cost 2 or 3 times what think – and you soundly explain why – you’ve simultaneously established a deep expertise AND shown the client you have their best interest at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it clear you are willing to stick to this claim, even if it means losing out on their project and not making a cent, because you think it’s in their best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A client hires you because you know more about your area of expertise then they do. Much like you’ve subscribed to this list because you’re looking for ways to improve your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the value pitch I want to make you, as one of my clients. If you’re reading this for pure intellectual stimulation and don’t intend on using any of it to help better your client’s, close the window now. The reason is simple: you can find a funnier and smarter email newsletter to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re looking to truly change your business, I feel it would be a disservice to your business to unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think you should invest MORE. The key is you have to implement the advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on that tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Robert&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to build a profitable sales funnel</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-off-what-is-a-sales-funnel&quot;&gt;First off, what is a sales funnel?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process that every freelance project goes through to land you a paying client. This includes how you win and find work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-most-sales-funnels-look-like&quot;&gt;What do most sales funnels look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every freelancer’s sales funnel is identical. You find a client online or through referral and proceed with a disorganized, inconsistent courting process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-inquiry&quot;&gt;Pre-inquiry&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is where a client or freelancer find one another. This can happen in a variety of places, like your portfolio, a website, referral or job posting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;inquiry&quot;&gt;Inquiry&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is usually an &lt;a href=&quot;http://emailsthatwin.com&quot; class=&quot;off-site&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt; made expressing interest in working together. Typically, this is inquiry is pretty short and simple, containing contact information and a little background on the project or freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;inquiry-review&quot;&gt;Inquiry Review&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The freelancer and client will each assess whatever information they’ve been given about working together, and if desired, schedule some sort of follow up meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;first-meeting&quot;&gt;First Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The freelancer and client meet over Skype, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsworkshop.com/phone-calls&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt;, or in person to discuss the project. Both sides give a rough idea of what they’re looking for, and receive a solid understanding of what working together will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal&quot;&gt;Proposal&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Usually you, the freelancer, will sit down to put together some sort of proposal that will put ink to paper about what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-review&quot;&gt;Proposal Review&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The client will receive your roadmap and possibly ask to refine/change it. This is usually a string of emails, questions, and back-and-forth about the project until most details are ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;revised-proposal-if-asked-to-change-first-proposal&quot;&gt;Revised Proposal (if asked to change first proposal):&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The freelancer will either present or send over a revised proposal. This may include a contract and invoice, at which point the client will either accept, decline, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsworkshop.com/freelancer-negotiation&quot;&gt;negotiate&lt;/a&gt; a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-actual-work&quot;&gt;The actual work&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is when you will begin work on the project, usually starting by learning as much as possible about the project and company you’re working with. Once you have adequately researched the project, you’ll begin creating the deliverables you and the client agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-can-i-improve-my-sales-funnel&quot;&gt;How can I improve my sales funnel?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve your sales funnel you must first identify what each step of the process looks like for you. Some freelancers might get most of their inquiries from referrals, others might use job boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified how your sales funnel is unique, you can identify where the problems are, like at what step potential clients are dropping off. Here are some good questions to start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what step are you deciding whether to take on a project?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there a better point in the sales funnel to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what step is a client’s decision to hire you made?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At what step do you want a client to make their decision?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what step do you think you’re ready to give a price quote?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have you ever given a price before this step?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If so, how can you ensure this doesn’t happen?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you putting too much importance on any one step? (hint: it’s step 8)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you eliminate as many steps as possible without losing clients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>How to make 2x more than other freelancers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Freelancers tend to beat around the bush when it comes to money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common to ask “what’s your hourly rate?” when what you’re really interested in knowing is how much a freelancer makes (and particularly how much more/less they make than you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hourly rate can be deceptive. All it gives you is a number. You’re left to piece how much they actually make, where they find work, and other important questions alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the reasons I surveyed hundreds of freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My survey asked three basic questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much do you make per month?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you do when you run out of work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much of your work comes from each source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;border-cell-only&quot; style=&quot;margin: 4em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;th colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
			The average freelancer based on survey results...
		&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
			earns &lt;strong&gt;$3,590&lt;/strong&gt; USD a month before taxes
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
			gets &lt;strong&gt;2.46&lt;/strong&gt; inquiries from their website per month
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
			makes &lt;strong&gt;61%&lt;/strong&gt; of their income from referrals
		&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;border-row-only&quot; style=&quot;margin: 4em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;When out of work they...&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;th&gt;Percent&lt;/th&gt;		
		&lt;th&gt;Income&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;th&gt;Difference&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Email prospects&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;$5,515&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class=&quot;good&quot;&gt;+91%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
		
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Look for work on a job board or marketplace&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;$3,257&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;+13%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Turn to their social media or network&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;$2,920&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Do nothing or wait&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;$2,316&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;-20%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results-were-clear-the-people-who-went-directly-to-prospects-by-emailing-them-made-almost-2x-more-than-everybody-else&quot;&gt;The results were clear: the people who went directly to prospects by emailing them made almost 2X more than everybody else.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, twice as many freelancers do nothing during a dry spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why do only 12% of people go direct, when it’s clear it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is it that it takes a lot more work to do outreach and when you’re used to billing hundreds of dollars for an hour of your time – spending that much time on something else besides billable work just isn’t the best use of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the rest of the course below will walk you through how to make this process 10x faster.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to double your cold email response rate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of freelancers get hung up on what they should say to a new prospect they’re cold emailing. Staring at a blank screen can be a horrible feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’ve developed this cold email checklist after studying thousands of emails and why they got ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to just dive in and write a quick, short rough draft email to your prospect. For more help with that, check out my book: &lt;a href=&quot;http://emailsthatwin.com&quot;&gt;Emails That Win You Clients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;once-you-have-your-first-draft-email-written-you-can-apply-a-few-quick-rules-to-it-to-make-sure-youre-maximizing-your-response-rate&quot;&gt;Once you have your first draft email written, you can apply a few quick rules to it to make sure you’re maximizing your response rate:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/subject.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The subject line should be so specific it could only be sent to one person in the world.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make sure your email gets opened because busy people look to remove spam first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/length.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The length of a cold email should be under 120 words.&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Busy people don&#39;t have time to read much. Make it simple, crisp, and get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/value.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Your email should provide something of value.&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Would you be happy to receive this email, even if you had no intention of hiring someone? Delivering advice or tips is an easy way to show you&#39;re on the client&#39;s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/social.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Don&#39;t include links to your social media or portfolio.&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A prospective client doesn&#39;t really care about your work... at least not yet. The only point of this first email is to get them to reply so making them click on your website, linkedin profile or portfolio doesn&#39;t help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/clarity.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; It should be easy to find the point of your email.
	&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Someone using a job board probably has a lot of email responses and is more likely to scan and look for the next step. Make that part of your email easy to find. Bold it if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/checklist/reply.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-check-circle&quot; style=&quot;color: #36b744;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The end of your email should be easy to reply to in seconds.
	&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t want to give a busy lead more work. If the lead can say &quot;sounds good&quot; you&#39;re probably on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-your-email-passes-all-of-these-rules-it-is-probably-ready-to-send-and-youll-have-a-30-50-chance-of-response-form-a-client&quot;&gt;If your email passes all of these rules, it is probably ready to send and you’ll have a 30-50% chance of response form a client.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have to land one of them. So how do yoy find a list of prospects you can email right now?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I find hundreds of leads + everything you need</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to tell you how to find 250+ great freelance leads by absolutely free, all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-what-youll-need&quot;&gt;Here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An RSS reader&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of job boards that feature freelance projects regularly. (Places to start: &lt;a href=&quot;http://authenticjobs.com&quot;&gt;Authentic Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weworkremotely.com&quot;&gt;We Work Remotely&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 40-60 minutes per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-things-first&quot;&gt;First things first:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the quality of the leads you’ll be finding is obviously important. They will become your clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you why the quality of the leads I find is &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; important to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a one-man shop that sends hundreds of freelancers the work they depend on to make a living. Freelance consultants rely on my leads to feed their families and keep their lights on. I take this extremely seriously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to make sure my time is being spent wisely. It means I can find more work, and every one of my clients has a higher chance of landing one of the leads I send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, get this: &lt;strong&gt;over a dozen of my clients have reported making more than $100,000 from my leads alone.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lt;— FYI, I was blown away when I heard that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means that my leads are under constant scrutiny by Workshop members, the quality of them is constantly being evaluated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means each day my process is put to the test…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I realize that every investment you make needs to generate results. You’re going to make a living off of opportunities that you find online and that makes it really important to do it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between working on projects, managing clients, reaching out to prospects, and sleeping – you’ve probably realized that your TIME is your most valuable asset. That’s why there’s two principles that should guide you in finding work: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principle-1-pick-the-low-hanging-fruit-first-and-dive-in&quot;&gt;Principle 1: Pick the low-hanging fruit first and dive in.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If can be consistent about contacting just a few leads each day, soon you’ll have a constant flow of prospects coming into your inbox every week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s not a numbers game – it’s a consistency game – so contacting a billion leads on your first day is going to have bad results. You’ll burnout then not contact anyone for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to make sure you’re consistent about it is to make it as easy on yourself as possible. Pick the low-hanging, most desirable projects first and contact them immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principle-2-get-specific-but-dont-be-so-picky-thatno-one-meet-your-requirements&quot;&gt;Principle 2: Get specific but don’t be so picky that no one meet your requirements.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What type of work do you love doing? Better yet, what are you better at than anyone else? If you’re able to answer these two questions effectively, you can narrow down your search to only clients that suit you – very quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: it’s good to get specific but don’t think that any lead will ever be an ”ideal client” from the start. The truth is ideal clients are born they’re bred. You have to educate them to make them be all that they can be.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this not only do you cut down your time, you cut out clients that are not a good fit for your consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping these two principles in mind has allowed me to develop a step-by-step system for finding great leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-5-step-system-for-finding-250leads-per-week&quot;&gt;The 5-step system for finding 250+ leads per week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-download-my-endless-clients-cheatsheathttpsgumroadcomlinstant-leads-and-plug-itinto-your-favorite-rss-reader&quot;&gt;Step 1: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/l/instant-leads&quot;&gt;Download my Endless Clients Cheatsheat&lt;/a&gt; and plug it into your favorite RSS reader.&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file comes pre-loaded with a huge chunk of job boards that I’ve collected over years of freelancing into an OPML file. All you need to do is import this file and you can instantly monitor almost every job board from your browser. I recommend starting with established job boards like Authentic Jobs and Behance.
Pro-tip: Use the additional criteria when available, like ‘remote’ and ‘freelance’ to skip all the location-specific or full-time listings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-find-niche-job-boards-that-apply-to-your-specialty&quot;&gt;Step 2: Find niche job boards that apply to your specialty&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For job boards that don’t offer RSS feeds, you will have to go through them by hand. This can get time consuming if you’re not familiar with where each job board keeps important details like location preference and whether they’re looking for freelance work. Building up a familiarity with these niche job boards takes time, but there are so many new job boards popping up that there are constant opportunities to land work (if you have the time to keep up).
Pro-tip: Look for a job board that is specific to your technology or design specialty. They all have their subtleties and hacks, so make sure you study your niche’s job board when you find one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-hack-google-search&quot;&gt;Step 3: Hack Google search&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find a ton of opportunities by searching Google and tweaking a few of the settings. For example, if you’re interested in responding to RFP’s, search: “RFP PDF website design development” and set your search range to the “past week” to only get recent results. Obviously there’s no limit to the amount of links you’ll find on google so getting specific with keywords, budget, search options, and anything else you can is really going to help.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-searching-on-twitter&quot;&gt;Step 4: Searching on twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of people turn to their twitter when looking for help on projects. However, searching through all the clutter on twitter can take hours and you probably wont find very much via their default search. Instead, use http://topsy.com/ because you’ll be able to customize your search much more effectively. The key to sorting through the multitudes of tweets out there is finding keywords people use when tweeting out for help. In addition to words like freelance, design, and development - add words like “email” (to find people who leave behind an email address) or “looking, need” (to find people who specifically want help).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-workshop-exclusive-leads&quot;&gt;Step 5: Workshop-exclusive leads&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had about 50 people post their freelance project exclusively on Workshop and no where else this year. That means my clients have about a 25% chance of landing one of these projects (simply by process of elimination). With the average project budget being around $10k-20k, these are some of the most valuable leads I find. You may not be able to generate as many leads from your website, but you should definitely be able to send people to your site and have it do some of the work of capturing leads for you.
Even after refining this process, it still takes me about 4 hours every day. That comes out to about 80 hours a month, excluding weekends. Cutting down on that time is key if you’re a freelancer, so that’s why Workshop members see huge ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I just told you the exact recipe for finding over 200 great leads per month. Am I scared you’re going to run off and do this for yourself, equaling lost business for me? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any freelancer who would rather spend 80 hours a month on a chore instead of $3/day to get it done… simply doesn’t see their business as an investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m only looking to work with those who do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Click here to get started.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Robert&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to use Twitter to find leads</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re probably not friends with the hundreds of people who turn to twitter looking for help on projects everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the most common thing freelancers do when they want to find work VIA Twitter yields no results. It’s usually tweeting something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I’m available for projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey guy - I’m looking for freelancer work..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;help … someone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is like expecting to find your next client by yelling into an echo-y cave with no one in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, if you wanted to find the love of your life and had no clue where they lived, who they were, or anything about them you probably wouldn’t post a notice at a supermarket saying seeking love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead a sounder approach would be to actually approach someone who appears to be a match, directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: you might text or call someone who gives you their number. You might approach someone at a bar or a dating website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are better options than the grocery store posting because they’re going to where the fish are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of expecting fate to intervene, you’re giving yourself the best chance. You should do the same with twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why post in your empty silo that is your twitter audience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, If you want to harness the power of twitter, try using something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://topsy.com&quot;&gt;Topsy&lt;/a&gt;. Searching through all the clutter on twitter can take hours and you probably wont find very much via their default search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, a service like Topsy can help you customize and sort your search more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to using words like freelance, design, and development - add words like “email” (to find people who leave behind an email address). Follow up with them over email instead of just on twitter. You can also set reminders and notifications via google alerts or tweetdeck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to sort through the multitudes of tweets out there by finding keywords people use when tweeting out for help and approaching them directly in a one to one setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not expecting your desperate tweets to bring in work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to respond to RFPs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any RFP I’m interested in, I ask them one simple question. If they can answer it directly, I’ll move forward. If not, I move on. In the last year, I’ve responded to two formal RFPs. I lost both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of RFPs is they’re usually written with an agency in mind. I know, I’ve been the guy they were written for before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared by Workshop member Kurt Elster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don’t even want to do it… they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap… just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don’t have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit’s their budget plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It’s nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it’s an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I’m a big fan of guaranteed income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who do the best with RFP’s (and are actually the people who’ve made $100k+ from workshop) are the ones who have a system in place for replying to RFP’s specifically. They either hire someone to help, or have developed such a templated and refined process that they can do it themselves in a fraction of the time. This usually means they see it as a numbers game and don’t sweat it when they don’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to use masterminds as a freelancer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a member of Workshop’s Mastermind group, I’ve shared knowledge, business practices, and what’s working for my businesses with other freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, four of us in the Mastermind group got to chat via Google Hangout and swap some stories. It was such a unique opportunity to sit down and chat with other designers and developers… something that unfortunately doesn’t happen all that often. I think we all get so busy with our work and what we’re producing that we forget to reach out and connect with others in our industry – and that’s perhaps one of the most important things we were lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by introducing ourselves and how we got to where we currently are in our business. We had a variety of skill levels, from someone doing front-end development for about a year to a back-end developer who had been going since 1999. We talked about our ideal clients, what we’re working on now (and how it’s going), and what challenges we’re facing in our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed how we can improve our skills and really hone our craft to become better designers and developers. I’m really looking forward to getting to know these guys and sharing what I learn from working with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared by Workshop member Kurt Elster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Alex,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across your website on twitter and I really love your work. You’ve been behind so many of my favorite designs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a freelance designer and illustrator as well, but I’ve struggled to find new clients lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you mind sharing a few tips on how you would look for new work (if you were starting out)? I’m always curious about how fantastic designers do things and 1 or 2 minutes of your time would be insanely valuable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: I hate networking. Most networking events leave me feeling somewhere between “so unclean I need to take a shower clothed” and “there isn’t enough xanax in the world to be cool right now.” Okay, I’m exaggerating, but networking events are rough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for people like me, mastermind groups are the ultimate networking hack. A mastermind group is a group of like-minded individual who meet regularly (usually once a week) to help each other out. Mastermind groups are even better when the people involved are from the same industry, working toward a common purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have Rob, reach out to me, and ask if I’d like to help run a new mastermind group for Workshop. Rob and I have bounced idea’s off each other before, and as usual, I thought it was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastermind groups have three great purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROBLEM SOLVING: Any question you ask, can be potentially solved by the group as a whole. Businesspeople and freelancers often feel like they’re going it alone, the mastermind group is also a support group. Even if they can’t solve a problem, the group can at least work out next steps to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACCOUNTABILITY: Every meeting closes with sharing each member sharing a goal they’d like to accomplish. The next week, they have to report to the group the status of that goal. Being held accountable is a powerful motivational tool that entrepreneurs often miss out on there own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NETWORKING: Everyone’s combined connections become the group’s total networking power. Have a problem that I know my colleague can solve? I’ll introduce you. That spirit of fraternal collaboration empowers the group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this isn’t my first mastermind group, this was my first meeting with the Workshop Sales Funnel Mastermind group, and I’ve already come with new business contacts, new friends, and even some actionable advice to promote my business. I’m looking forward to future conversation with the group, I can’t wait to see what we accomplish together.&lt;/p&gt;
