  <h2 id="rfps-make-most-firms-anxious">RFPs make most firms anxious</h2>

  <p>RFPs represent a double-edged sword to consulting firms. They’re some of the biggest projects we stand a chance at winning, but they can seem like the most time-consuming and least likely to win.</p>

  <p>The truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>

  <p>And there’s a lot more common ground than you think. You can cut down your response time to an RFP under a thirty minutes a week but following the steps in this guide.</p>

  <p>If you hate writing them just as much as you hate reading them. Yet, there’s great projects waiting to be won. Learn how to make more money in less time responding to RFPs with this short field guide.</p>

</div>

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  <p>The key here is to ask an extremely simple question. How simple? You want even the busiest person in the world to be able to respond.</p>

  <p>Now, onto the second and third emails.</p>

	<div class="email-message">
		<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: great project
		
		<hr style="margin: .5em 0;" />

		<p>I'm following up to see if you're still looking for proposals. If so, I'd love to see how we can work together. </p>
		
		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

  <p>Look, I know these emails look too simple.</p>

  <p>But don’t be afraid, you’re simply following up on an email you sent. You’re not going to bug the person you’re emailing, they’re busy, they might not have time to get back to you at the exact moment you emailed them.</p>

  <p>So a couple simple follow-up emails is all you need.</p>

  <h2 id="your-loop-closer">Your Loop Closer</h2>

		<p>Since I have not heard from you on this, I have to assume your priorities have changed.</p>
		
		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

  <p>This email is dubbed <a href="http://themagicemail.com">The Magic Email</a> because it works so well at getting a client who has ignored you to respond.</p>

  <p>It’s considerate because you’re taking the initiative to close the loop on the conversation that never started.</p>

  <p>This is how professionals close the loop.</p>

<div>
        <p><strong>Use the Q+A process</strong><br />
The Q+A process is one of the most underrated portions of the RFP process. Most consultants overlook it, but it’s the best way to make inroads with the person you’re contacting.</p>

<div>
        <p><strong>Include options</strong><br />
Inside your proposal you should have a few different packages that clients can choose from. This is something I learned in <a href="http://freepricingcourse.com/?ref=workshop">Brennan Dunn’s free pricing course</a>. Strongly recommended.</p>

<div>
        <p><strong>Call them</strong><br />
One of the best ways to stand out is to give prospects a ring. One of the benefits of RFPs is that they almost always include a phone number. A simple 5-minute phone call introducing yourself can be enough to separate you from the pack. Pro-tip pick up the phone</p>

        <p>If an RFP starts dictating button colors, pick up the phone. It’s a cry for help and your opportunity to create mutual understanding. Speaking directly to a designer may be what they need, much more than getting 325 replies to a badly-formed RFP. Remember, not all organizations who send out formal documents have to.</p>

  <h2 id="create-your-own-luck-on-purpose">Create your own luck… on purpose</h2>
  <p>With RFPs there’s always going to be some luck involved. However, you can also create the opportunity for luck to strike by putting yourself in the right position. Be consistent. Send 50-100 RFPs over the course of a year. Followup consistently. Suddenly, you’ll find that you get a lot luckier.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1 id="now-that-youre-an-rfp-master-where-the-heck-do-you-find-rfps">Now that you’re an RFP master… where the heck do you find RFPs?</h1>

  <p>So far we’ve covered how to make it dead simple to reply to RFPs and give yourself the best possible chance at finding them.</p>

  <p>The last part of this guide will be dedicated to finding them and reducing the amount of time this takes.</p>

  <p>Why? Because it can actually be really time consuming to find RFPs. The problem is they’re usually spread around the web.</p>

  <p>Companies post them on their website and share them with a few people they know. That can make them difficult to find.</p>

  <h2 id="they-key-is-to-make-rfps-come-to-you">They key is to make RFPs come to you…</h2>

  <p>Luckily there’s a few websites that help. Below I’ve compiled the best sources for RFPs I’ve found over years of testing.</p>

  <p>Instead of chasing down RFPs across thousands of websites, you can monitor a few sites. Let’s start with my service though. Here’s some recent RFPs I’ve found and sent to members of this website:</p>

  <p>All of these RFPs are high-quality projects I found myself in the last few days. I send them to paying members of my service <a href="/">Workshop</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/google-logo.svg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;" /></p>

  <p>Google is actually a great source for RFPs because what you want is to search across thousands of independent websites.</p>

  <p>The trick is you want to type <span class="include-this">type:pdf</span> in your search. That way you get PDFs of the RFPs you’re looking for, like so:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/google-type-pdf-tutorial.gif" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 5px;" /></p>

  <p>Next you’re going to want to change your search results to show you stuff created in the last week. Google doesn’t do this automatically so it will save you some time not finding and getting excited about an RFP from last year.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/google-past-week.gif" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 5px;" /></p>

  <p>Overall as a source of leads Google ranks pretty high among the services I’ve tried.</p>

  <h1 id="rfpdbcom">RFPdb.com</h1>

  <p>Another great source of RFPs is RFPdb. The site is credit-based so you pay for a minimum of 10 credits and you can access RFPs (2 credits each).</p>

  <p>You can also share RFPs on the site to get access to more credits. Every RFP has a free (censored) blurb about the project.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/rfpdb.png" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 5px;" /></p>

  <p>Usually, you can gain enough from this blurb to tell whether it’s relevant to you or not. That way you don’t waste credits on an RFP you don’t care about.</p>

  <p>Quality leads per week: 2-3 a week</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don’t even want to do it… they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap… just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don’t have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit’s their budget plan. As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It’s nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky! For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it’s an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I’m a big fan of guaranteed income. Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances. Shared by Workshop member Corey Tiani</p>
