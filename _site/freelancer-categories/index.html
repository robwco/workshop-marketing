  <p>“There’s no rule that says you need to describe what you’re doing in one word.” - Ryan Singer, Designer, Basecamp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virtually every freelancer uses vague or confusing terms to describe what they do. UI designer. Back-end developer. UX designer. Wordpress developer.</p>

<p>These terms have meaning to you but to most of the world, a Wordpress developer is somebody that works at Wordpress. Even people in the design industry don’t know what a UX designer does.</p>

<p>Those terms put workers inside of a box and disconnect them from what they’re actually selling; the benefits of their work. So why do we use these terms with clients? Why don’t we focus on the outcome we deliver?</p>

<p>By far, the number one feature request I get is members want a more personalized, “tailored-to-me” list of opportunities that is relevant to them and nobody else. It makes total sense and <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">the high quality (and free) Workshop-exclusive leads</a> I find are great at this.</p>

<p>But besides spending 5+ hours on each individual member my only other option is using categories that leads can fall under, and that each member can look through quickly.</p>

<p>This may sound like a mundane task but it’s actually an opportunity to categorize what we do. The end result is something that I hope will focus more on selling a benefit of a service than just a service.</p>

<p><strong>The exact opposite of freelancer.com’s category list:</strong>
<img src="/images/freelancercategories.png" alt="Freelancer.com's list of categories" /></p>

<p>That list is ridiculous. It’s the epitome of vague industry terms that nobody knows the definition for.</p>

<p>Even I have no clue what most of the terms listed on Freelancer.com even mean. It’s hard enough to understand design and development jargon when you’re familiar with it (like user experience design), if you’re completely unfamiliar, like a client, you stand no chance.</p>

<p>Worst of all, a person looking to hire a freelance consultant just doesn’t care. That’s why we don’t bother to learn these terms in the first place. Good freelance shops aren’t commodities. A list of categories that focus on things like what language they code in are focused on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>People are looking to pay for an outcome. They want results. They want a problem to go away. Any list of categories that ignores these results is arbitrary and will do you a disservice if you use it.</p>

<p>When I look for a gig that can go on Workshop I’m not just looking for people who say they need freelancers. It’s great if they do but I’m also looking for people that say they just need a problem solved. It’s always going to be the freelancer’s job to educate them on what that looks like.</p>

<p>If they say they want Wordpress but Rails is better for their needs, it’s the consultants job to educate them.</p>

<p>I’ll be taking all of this and updating the <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/connect">Post a Project to Workshop form</a> soon. It’s free for the next few days, so if you’re looking for a freelancer or consultancy (that focuses on results), now’s a great time to find one!</p>
