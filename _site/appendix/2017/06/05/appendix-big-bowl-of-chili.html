  <p>Dear Robert,</p>

  <p>It’s been honor to help some of you make well over six-figures in revenue the past few years. That’s why I’m really excited about what’s coming.</p>

  <p>If you make over $100,000 a year from freelancing or running your own shop…</p>

  <p><a href="#">Watch the video below.</a></p>

  <p>Again, for now, this is ONLY if you make over $100,000 a year, if you don’t yet - hang tight! I got something coming that will help you in the next few months as well.</p>

<p>Writing that sells your freelance or agency service. Why writing is the most important thing you can focus on. Think about the words you use will help on</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emails</li>
  <li>Blog posts</li>
  <li>Phone calls</li>
  <li>Other content you create (videos, ebooks, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This video course started with writing an outline. You deliver value with your words. Basics of writing words that sell your company. How to approach writing (always put yourself in the other companies shoes). Make it about them, it’s not about you. Don’t rush someone through the process. Build trust by delivering value to them. It’s about timing. Sending the right message at the right time. It’s about context. Sending the right message for the situation. Presenting your value to a client through words. By exhibiting the value you’ll provide (in the next video we’ll dive into some real examples). As we go through great example emails in the next two sections, focus on understanding the psychology behind the great emails, not simply copying the words.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-number-of-freelancing-leads-you-need-each-month">The magic number of freelancing leads you need each month</h2>

<p>This article is going to show you how to end dry spells forever. It has the exact formula to making six figures this year and beyond.  I know because I was making that much. But I didnt always. I started freelancing the hard way. I didn’t have any clients. I didn’t have portfolio. I hadn’t charged for my work before. Despite all of that, I was still able to make six figures. I didn’t do anything special or have amazing flawless work. That’s how I know anyone can have the same results. In fact, with a few improvements you can easily make a multiple of what I did.  And you can do it your way. It’s your business. You started freelancing for a reason. To create your own thing. So look at these lessons as a starting point but do things your way. I’m just here to tell you what works.</p>

<p>Now, here’s the formula: to make 6-figures in a year you need to attract 30 leads a month. That’s the magic number I’ve observed over hundreds of freelance and agency businesses.</p>

<p>It’s that simple, if you hit that many leads you’ll get a new client each month. If you don’t you’ll run into the feast or famine cycle. You’ll stress out about where your next project will be coming from. You’ll take on bad projects just because you’re desperate.</p>

<p>The good news is you control this number. This course is going to systematize how you hit this number each month.</p>

<p>Action steps</p>

<ul>
  <li>Realize you need 30 leads coming in to get one client</li>
  <li>Think about ways to making reaching this number easier</li>
  <li>Stop doing everything unless it’s directly helping you get 30 leads a month</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-get-more-than-enough-work---even-if-youre-not-established-yet">How to get more than enough work - even if you’re not established yet</h2>

<p>You’ve heard me say lead a few times already in this course. If you’re wondering what exactly a lead is, there’s actually a few different types. And some are more valuable than others. For example a lead can be inbound which means it’s a potential client that’s coming to you from your website or your network like a referral.</p>

<p>A lead can also be outbound meaning that it’s someone YOU went out and found. If you aren’t established yet, like I wasn’t, you won’t have as many inbound leads coming in.</p>

<p>However, you still need 30 leads a month. So to make up for it you need to get extra outbound leads at first. You might even need to find all 30 leads yourself each month at first.</p>

<p>As you progress and get more experience the ratio will even out. In later lessons I’ll show you how to make 50% of your leads will be inbound. This takes a long time to get going and unit then, you’ll need to do outreach. You can’t skip this step.</p>

<p>Lastly, this may sound like it takes a lot of time to get going, and it does. That why this course is focused on automation. You’ll be setting it up once so it keeps working for years.</p>

<p>Action steps
Half of your leads should be inbound
If you don’t have 15 inbound leads a month your website and network need work
Until then, make up for it with extra outbound leads</p>

<h1 id="you-dont-need-many-clients">You don’t need many clients</h1>
<p>## It only takes one to end your dry spell.</p>

<p>Most people do nothing when they run out of work. They simply sit and wait.</p>

<p>Others post on Twitter and update their portfolios. These tasks feel like work, but they won’t get you paid.</p>

<p>So why do we focus on them? The reason is pretty simple: we’re not used to being direct. We’re used to marketing created by the big guys. They talk to all of us at once, because they need millions of customers.</p>

<p>But you don’t.</p>

<p>You have an advantage. You have a much clearer path. You earn money by getting paying clients, so all you need is a handful of customers.</p>

<p>Unlike the big guys, you can afford to get direct with your marketing. You can invest your time and resources in straight-up communication.</p>

<p>You can weigh and measure all of your actions according to how they help you achieve your goal of <strong>getting paid by clients</strong>. You can ask yourself at any time, “is this directly helping me to reach my goal?”</p>

<p>You can clearly decide which activities are a total waste of time by asking, “has doing this landed me any clients?”</p>

<p>That’s why sending emails has a bigger effect on your career than any other activity. It’s time to do it better.</p>

<p>Many freelancers complain that there’s not enough work to go around – that every online source of work is already inundated, but think about that for a second.</p>

<p>There are thousands of job boards on the web, listing thousands of jobs, and millions of people who need a problem solved. Even if you found just one potential client each day, that would would add up to over 20 per month.</p>

<p>If you emailed all 20 people this month, using the techniques outlined in this book, you’re almost guaranteed to land one – and that’s only taking job boards into account. The chips are in your favor.</p>

<h1 id="what-should-you-name-your-service">What should you name your service?</h1>

<p>Have you ever not known what to call something?</p>

<p>I always thought naming something was the hardest thing about of web design but recently I realized something. It’s <strong>most</strong> of what designing for the web is. The stuff you build gets built <em>because</em> you to know what to say / write. This applies to stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing website copy</li>
  <li>Sending emails</li>
  <li>Designing graphics</li>
  <li>Coding sites and apps</li>
  <li>Writing books</li>
  <li>Naming products</li>
</ul>

<p>What separates the bad from the great isn’t great graphics or an intuitive UI. That stuff helps but what matters is what’s written. That informs everything.</p>

<p>It all comes back to the content and knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Why? Because design is about words. Most of what we do is about shaping words. That’s the biggest element on the web. Most online businesses seem to forget and/or ignore it.</p>

<p>… improve the value of the ones you have.</p>

<p>Dear Eric,</p>

<p>Would you believe a simple letter can provoke a reply from a senior director, even a CEO?</p>

<p>Well, with the right approach, they do.</p>

<p>Chief Executives of companies like HSBC, Whitbread, Consignia, Co-Op bank and other have personally replied to letters – and agreed to meetings - with firms they have never heard of before. We know, because we wrote those letters they replies to.</p>

<p>And you can do the same - if you let us write your next mailing.</p>

<p>Cynical about my claim? I’m sure. So just send me a blank reply to this mail and I’ll send you some actual examples of the letters I’m talking about.</p>

<p>I thought as a key executive of SmallRiverSoftware you would appreciate knowing how you can profit from this targeted exposure - especially if you sell something complex, expensive or have a long sales cycle (if you have all three we should really talk).</p>

<p>Sadly, most sales activities scream of an unsolicited approach. What you need is something powerful enough to catch the attention of somebody senior enough, to create an opportunity. This is where we come in, or rather, where my partner, direct marketing expert Robert Williams, and I do.</p>

<p>The process if simple. We write the copy, you send the letters. At worst your letters will get read, at best they will tee up the kind of meeting your salespeople usually go to great length (and vast expense) for.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to put a price on a meeting with people you would dearly love to do business with, but I’ll wager you it is more than our fee. And don’t forget, all we care about are results.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the companies that use us are the ones already doing well - but they want to do even better. Does this sounds like you? If you could improve your effectiveness even slightly, is it worth looking into? Just send me a blank reply and I’ll get more information to you.</p>

<p>Or, why not give me a call at 760-693-3360 while it is still fresh in your mind? You have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Best Regards
Rob Williams

<p>How you land work with email
Every freelance community is full of people struggling to finding work.
Most are in search of magic solutions. Questions like “where do you find good clients?” and “what is the best job board?” are asked in every watering hole.
It’s debatable whether there are even real answers to these questions — worse — I think these are the wrong questions to ask altogether.
I get why people ask them. In fact, I asked these questions too.
But the fact that they’re so common amongst people who are struggling to find work should make you re-consider asking them yourself.
After all, do you want to emulate people who are struggling?</p>

<p>What are you really saying?
As a design student, I focused most of my time on my portfolio. I thought just having an excellent portfolio would make all of the difference.
I agonized over every detail, every stroke, and every pixel, making sure it presented me and my work perfectly.
I wanted my work to speak for itself.
When it came time to look for a job, I wasn’t so precise. I’m embarrassed to say, I’d send rambling, call-to-action-less, and confidence-free emails.
And that’s what I see freelancers doing still.
(How many times have we all ended an email with “let me know what you think…”)
Think about the emails you’re sending. Are you thinking before you send them or is your brain on auto-pilot?
What are you really saying?</p>

<p>Emails you open
Think about the emails you open without a second thought.
They’re usually emails from friends and family. The language in them is completely different from professional emails.
They address you by name and get to the point quickly. Usually they end with a yes or no question or a simple set of instructions.</p>

<p>The subject line</p>

<p>￼
A good subject.
If I received an email with this title, I’d open it immediately.
Whoever sent this email knows who I am and what I do.
They even know that I’ve written a book called Emails That Win You Clients.
What does that mean?
It means they couldn’t send this email to just anyone. It means this isn’t spam.
The most common subject lines freelancers send are generic ones that provide no incentive to open the email. They’re typically phrases like“Freelance Web Developer” or “freelance design help”.
They’re too broad and too general. They are subject lines that could literally be from any freelancer in the world to any client in the world.
Your subject line should be so specific it could only be sent to one person in the world.
This will make sure your email gets opened because busy people look to remove spam first.</p>

<p>Your first sentence</p>

<p>￼
Why social media links are a bad thing to send.
Most freelancers don’t get the point I just made about getting specific. Instead they focus on themselves:
“I know illustrator.”
“I know rails.”
“I can help write blog posts.”
“I’m an awesome freelancer and I also bake and do accounting.”
Again, these are all things you can send to anyone.
Even if this is a custom-written email, focusing on you makes it generic. Why put yourself in that position?
Think about an email from a friend.
Do they say, “Hello, I’m your friend, I’m interested in discussing your plans for this evening. My favorite food is Chinese, and my favorite genre of movie is comedy. Let me know if you’re interested?”
No!
If they did you would avoid that freak like the plague.
And yet, freelancers send that email everyday because it’s easy to write. It takes no effort. No consideration.
Instead you should say how you heard about them and why you’re emailing them.
It sounds obvious, but this is the part of an email that takes the most time to get right.
Why? Because you need to exhibit an intimate understanding about their specific situation.
Lead with something you know they’ll find interesting and that shows you actually know something about them.
“Hello Rob, I came across your amazing medium article where you say to lead with something interesting, and… boom.”
As you continue writing, don’t forget to keep the email speaking about the person you’re emailing.
Don’t include links to your social media or portfolio. A prospective client doesn’t care about your work… at least not yet.
The only point of this first email is to get them to reply. Making them click on your website, linkedin profile or portfolio makes this less likely to happen.
So it doesn’t help you.</p>

<p>What to leave out</p>

<p>￼
It’s really important to keep it short.</p>

<p>￼
By keeping it short, you make it easier to find the point of your email.
When I email potential clients I speak in relation to what they need. It’s important you don’t talk over a client’s head.
Don’t go into your spiel about <em>insert boring specialty</em>. Use words that they use to talk about their business.
A lot of times this is easy to find, because you can simply scan their job posting, steal their words and spit them back at them.
You might not use these words, but client’s sure don’t use yours.
Once you’re sure you’re not saying too much make sure you’re not writing too much either. The length of your email should be under 120 words.
Busy people don’t have time to read much. Make it simple, crisp, and get to the point. It should be easy to find the point of your email.
Someone running a business probably has a lot of emails and is more likely to scan and look for the next step.
Make that part of your email easy to find. Bold it if you have to.</p>

<p>The point of your email</p>

<p>￼
Is your email helpful?
Maybe the most important question to ask before you send the email is whether you’d be happy to receive it.
The result of a successful project with you will affect their business and their daily life. This email should be an extension of that result.
Nobody cares about great design. Nobody cares about clean code. Nobody wants to have the best content just to have it. It’s all about what it means for them.
A great SEO strategy means that a business owner doesn’t have to worry about promoting articles and can just focus on making customers happy.
A web app means that the business owner can outsource a process and have it taken out of their hands.
Delivering this realization is valuable. It’s an easy way to show you’re on the client’s side.
If you simply talk about the benefits in terms of technical jargon they’ll never figure it out on their own. You have to explicitly call them out.
Your email should provide something of value. Even if it’s you connecting the dots on how their project will make their life better.
Would you be happy to receive this email, even if you had no intention of hiring someone?</p>

<p>The end of your email</p>

<p>￼
Make sure what to do next is clear.
Freelancers regularly shoot themselves in the foot with their closing statement.
“I’m not sure if you may be interested in something like this, but if you are feel free to let me know what you would like to do.”
Freelancers unwisely close their emails like this to make sure they’re not sounding pushy.
However, it does them no good.
Closing an email like this undermines your credibility. The person receiving your email doesn’t want to think. They’re busy. By finishing an email like this you’re making them do all the work.
You’re saying, “look I just took a brain dump , and I don’t know what to say next, so I’m going to nope out of this email and leave it up to you to figure it out and get back to me”
Take work away from your clients, don’t give them more.
Emails should end in two things ways.
	.	A yes or no question.
	.	Suggested instructions on what to do next.
Or both.
Your email should be written based on what this next action step is.
For emails where you’re contacting potential clients, that means you include how to move forward assuming they’re interested.
As a freelancer, it’s your job to assume they’re interested, and to write the email as though you’ve already gotten the project.
This makes everything more comfortable for the client because they feel they’re working with a confident, experienced, professional who does this all the time.
I’d like to discuss the details, sometime this week, if you are interested. If so, would it be okay if I sent you a few ideas on how I could help?
The only goal for an email should be to get a one word reply from the busy person, preferably a “Yes.”
The end of your email should be easy to reply to in seconds.
You don’t want to give a busy lead more work. If the lead can say “sounds good” you’re probably on the right track.</p>

<p>What to expect by following these rules
The best place to find your next client is in your inbox. Following this system will force you to send quality emails.
You can set yourself apart from 99% of freelancers by simply writing clear, concise emails.
Following this system will mean a 30–50% response rate. By sending fewer, better emails you’ll out perform people sending thousands of generic emails 10 to 1, with less effort.</p>

<p>My website’s design is beautiful, but it isn’t growing my business.
Elliot responded to my 2-minute design challenge email a few weeks ago because his website, Brightalyze, was in need of some help.
It receives compliments left and right, but is not converting — and the project was losing money as a result.
It’s a classic example of how design is not always the most important thing when it comes to web projects. That facts are; 90% of the web is type — and although the site was sleek and pretty, it was still out of touch with the pain-points of people visiting the site.
Since most people visiting a website will only ever see the headline, that’s what we’ll be focusing on when discussing how to improve this site.
It does a great job of looking like an established and trust-worthy company, both benefits of good branding. However, branding does not inspire people to try out a service, it only makes you not discount the company immediately.
Ultimately what will cause people to try the service is the offering.
The headline reads, “Create the World’s Next Great App”.
And the sub-head supports with, “Brightalyze helps with challenges of development, so you can relax.”
At first, these two sentences seem like they’re answering solid pain points for the user. However, if we dig a little deeper the truth is they are both quite vague.
For example, we don’t get answers to how will Brightalyze do these things, and why are they better than an established competitor at doing these things? We don’t even get answers to what exactly the service is, is it an iphone app, a web app, an online course, a concierge service etc.?
I didn’t know the answer to these questions either, so I asked Elliot. His response was, “We provide project management to incubate the project, that other services do not.”
That is actually a great selling point, and valuable service, much better than saying a blanket generic statement about ‘creating the world’s next great app’.
However, it’s not answering what pain it is solving.
So, how do you find what pain your product is solving? Would you believe me if I said that great wallet-bursting copywriting doesn’t happen in your head? It actually comes from your clients mouths. They are constantly talking about what they like and don’t like in public places (especially online).
To find this you simply need to search for the pain. It could be a reddit thread on r/freelance, it could be the comments of a blog article, it could even be in conversation with a client… but one of the best places to find these pain quotes is Amazon.
If you look at books on your topic, than look at the reviews for that book (particularly the 5 star and 1 star sections) you will find a great list of pains and delights that you can reverse-engineer to create beautiful copy.
The best part is you wont have to do too much work to make the messages resonate with your customer, because you are already using their words!
A quick Amazon review query resulted in various different pain points for freelance design clients, including:
	•	“I spent hours sifting through hundreds of Dribbble profiles”
	•	“When you work with a freelancer, you’re gambling.”
	•	“I just can’t relax and trust them.”
	•	“Design is often a failed effort at organizations.”
	•	“Finding a designer was like mining for gold.”
	•	“Design is a differentiating factor, but I just can’t nail it”
	•	“You hire a guy to design your website… and three months later nothing.”
How’s that for pain? Who knew the design profession was causing so many late nights for so many people. There’s literally thousands more pain points on amazon just waiting to me mined.
What do all of these pains deal with? Uncertainty. Stress. Trust. Time-wasting.
These are all things that Brightalyze can help with. Does “Create the World’s Next Great App” get that across? No.
I’ll be sending Elliot my suggestions for what the headline should say, but I also want to hear from you. If this was your site, what would you say in your headline?
How would you combine these pain points with his service offering of “project management that incubates projects?” Reply to this email and I’ll pass along the message.

<p>Hire copy first, design second, code third
Words are design. If you’re hiring someone to design your site, they should start with words. If they don’t or they can’t than you should hire someone else. If you have a designer already but they don’t know how to write copy you may want to reconsider that designer. Until then, hire a copywriter. Make every design go through the copywriter before it gets to the designer. Likewise, your website, your app, or your software should all go through the designer before it gets to the developer. You can’t develop something soundly without sound design in place first. Development is also design. It’s all design really. </p>

<h1 id="typography-for-client-service-businesses">Typography for Client Service Businesses</h1>

<p>There’s two things at the heart of design. Copywriting, and typography. Unsurprisingly both of these deal with words.</p>

<p>Words are what our live revolve around. Think about the last time you bought, consumed, or enjoyed something. It’s very likely words were involved at some point in presenting this thing to you.</p>

<p>Presenting the thing to you is what design is about. You can’t get to the buying, consuming or enjoying until you’ve been presented with words.</p>

<p>Sure color, shapes, images, and all of these graphical elements play a role. But what we’re really trying to shape is words. Even a purely graphical design is trying to convey words you feel.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s getting kind of abstract. Let’s take a real example. Your clients. Throughout their engagement with you, they’re going to be confronted with words.</p>

<p>Words you’ve created. These words are what will decide whether they buy from you, are happy with the work, or hate your guts and ask for a refund.</p>

<p>Have you ever done some of your finest work in your career – only to feel nervous when it’s time to present to the client? (Worse, have you ever had that work rejected by the client?)</p>

<p>Why is that? If your work is so great why isn’t it enough to win over the client on it’s own?</p>

<p>At the end of the day the work doesn’t matter if you can’t get sell your ideas. You do that with words.</p>

<p>So have you looked at the words you’ve used with clients lately? Are you calling them out or are you just going through the motions?</p>

<p>The way you’re speaking  – is it because you’ve chosen it specifically – or because it’s just the way you think you should?</p>

<p>Look at the words on your website, in your emails, in your email signature, the words you use on sales calls, in your proposals – how are they helping present you?</p>

<p>Then comes the next questions – beyond even the content of these words, how are you presenting these words graphically. Are they all legible? Are they easy to read? Does their hierarchy make sense?</p>

<p>Or are you sending a 5000 word, un-formatted, rambling and 8 pt font sized hard to read email? (Didn’t realize that typography happens even in an email?)</p>

<p>Are you choosing each word you write? Are you choosing how to present these words?</p>

<p>If you’re not, you might be losing on one of the most important decisions you make in whether your business gets and finds clients.</p>

<p>“Typography doesn’t matter.”
“Copywriting doesn’t matter.”
“Design doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>I bet if I asked you how you deliver value to existing clients you could come up with at least a short list of ways you’ve delivered value to clients in the past. What about clients you’ve never worked for? How could you deliver value to them? This gets a little tougher. You don’t know enough about their project. You’re not really sure how you can deliver value because the possibilities seem endless. You may think that every new client is completely unique, but the opposite is true.</p>

<p>Most clients are battling the exact same issues and can use the exact same solutions to solve those issues. So if you found one way to deliver value to a client, you can probably use that with multiple clients. Now finding ideas for how you can help a client is actually simple once you use a few indicators.</p>

<p>First use a real client you want to work for. Pick an actual lead or find a dream client. It doesn’t matter if you think you can help them right now. Using a real client is important because you are going to look at their website for clues. You can read their book. You don’t want to dream up this stuff out of thing air.</p>

<p>Are they asking questions? Does their website miss out on one big opportunity? What would you do differently if you were in their shoes?</p>

<p>Okay now let’s make it a little tougher.</p>

<p>How can you deliver a fix to their problem right now? In the next 15-20 minutes?</p>

<p>How can you deliver a fix that’s free? And won’t cost you anything to produce.</p>

<p>You might thing these constraints are going to make it tougher but you’ll find the opposite is true. Constraints are counter-intuitive. They actually help you be more creative, not restrict your ideas. Brainstorm ideas for how you can help a client.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about some examples. Off the top of my head, I wrote down a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A podcast you’ve listened to recently that you recommend they check out.</li>
  <li>A book that will help them get X desired benefit.</li>
  <li>An article that walks them through how to set up advanced analytic tracking.</li>
  <li>A free plugin they can use to triple their email optins.</li>
  <li>A new app you discovered that will boost their productivity.</li>
  <li>How about a guide or email course?</li>
  <li>Better yet, have YOU created some of these things?</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick is you want to provide help for their specific situation. By doing this you’re 10X more likely to prove you can help them, because you’re literally helping them instead of just claiming it.</p>

<p>Make sure you don’t just find anything. Find and recommend valuable things that you truly use or believe in. Now, granted this does take a while. You can’t invest this much time in each individual lead. But you’re not going to.</p>

<p>Look at this process as an investment in all of your future leads. Because you’re going to be re-using these value bombs on multiple leads. In fact, once you find just one, send it to the client.</p>

<p>Send it to them in a helpful email like:</p>

<p>“I sent a buddy of mine to your website and he apparently got your message spam boxed automatically. That shouldn’t happen to a legit mailer like you. I’ve gotten pretty good at getting people off of those auto-classified of spam and into mailboxes. You shouldn’t be losing business because I assure you use are. What’s your hit-rate right now?”</p>

<p>Send that email off. Even if they’re not interested in your service, they’ll be interested in the free goodie. They’ll be flattered you took the time to think of them.  In fact, they’ll feel a duty to reply to you. So this is all good and well but I promised this would teach you how to deliver value without spending too much time.</p>

<p>Well the truth is you’re already done. Finding one valuable thing you can send to cold prospects, and having an email you can send them means you can now duplicate this cold email. It’s time to find more people that can benefit from the same idea. Don’t move on to finding the  next valuable thing until you’ve emailed at least 50-100 prospects who can benefit form this same idea. This is how you scale your efforts delivering value to prospects without spending too much time.</p>

<p>Once you come across someone you really want to work for but the value bomb you just created doesn’t fit perfectly, that’s when it’s time to create your next. Not a minute sooner. Over time you’ll start to collect these value bombs so you don’t have to find them from scratch.</p>

<p>As you find new leads, new leads will simply fall into a few different categories and you can choose from your collection of value bombs. You can even use multiple value bombs through out the courting process with your leads.  Always be delivering value. Just don’t waste man hours on this task. Make it simple, fun, and light-hearted.</p>

<p>Sure you won’t win work from every single client you send value to but you will build a network. These people will have gotten something of value from you. They will have received a self-less act that you can use to your advantage in the future.</p>

<p>Hey!
I have an exciting and very valuable announcement to make. About a year and a half ago, a bunch of my friends (including some Workshop customers) started a mastermind group for independent consultants that package their service into productized offerings.
Because they all had similar productized services (or retainers) and understood each others goals and business model so well, they were able to help one another make huge leaps in their businesses quickly.
Soon they started releasing full-blown products and making a ton of money from their services.
At least two people told me that this group has been the most important thing to happen to their business in the past two years. I can totally see why.
So what does this mean for you? Well you probably are a bit envious right now. There’s no question that the amount of wisdom shared by close to a dozen fantastic freelancers is hard to replicate on your own. But they just released something that I think does just that.
You can’t join the mastermind I told you about as they’re currently full but they did just co-author a book together: The Independent Consulting Manual. It’s a how-to guide for building a strong, durable independent consulting business in the tech industry. It’s literally got hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of insights collected and scraped from the walls of their mastermind.
Each person wrote one or two essays about the topics that they care about deeply and have an intimate expertise in. The result is four hundred freaking pages, packed with all sorts of actionable advice on how to start a business and balance it with an awesome, well-lived life.
It’s written by a serious group of all-stars. The foreword was written by Bryce Bladon of Clients From Hell fame, and the first chapter, entitled “Quit Your Job” was written by freelancing superhero Brennan Dunn.
I could not be prouder of them or the product they’ve shipped, and I hope you give it a close look. The “complete bundle” gives you loads of bonus ebooks too. Including a PDF of Nick Disabato’s Cadence &amp; Slang for free – the first time he’s ever sold that book outside of his own purview – as well as two dozen other freebies and awesome discounts on business tools.</p>

<p>Buy the Complete Package (most popular) –&gt; https://gumroad.com/a/1018311795/RkaW</p>

<p>Buy the Basic Package for (most affordable) –&gt;  https://gumroad.com/a/1018311795/uIwgr</p>

<p>Buy the Strategy Package (most valuable) –&gt;  https://gumroad.com/a/1018311795/BTdfx</p>

<p>We’re nearing the end of the year, which is a perfect time for you to grab a bunch of awesome books and brush up on your business skills (and doubles as a tax writeoff too).
Also, all bundles are discounted by 20% for a little while after launch, so if you act fast you’ll pocket that money. Take a look at the Independent Consulting Manual and grab a copy today! It’s a no-brainer for anyone who sells services and wants to level up (YOU).

<p>I’ve been giving away some really valuable <em>free</em> bonus material on Medium lately. It feels great to give stuff away that I know is going to help people.</p>

<p>I recently gave away:</p>

<p>My 2-step Email Closer That Attracts Clients
(In an article with the email line that’s client repellent you should avoid.)</p>

<p>It’s great to give this valuable stuff away becaues I know it’s helping people. My strategy has always been to give away a ton of value for free, then ask you to take a next step (like opting in for a email list or purchase). I do this because it makes you take action instead of passively consuming. Action is in your best interest because it doesn’t matter if you you’re reading the best content in the owrld if you don’t act on it.  So creating action is another way I provide you value.</p>

<p>If you got value from any of the articles or downloads I just mentioned, I have a special bonus exclusively for you (you can’t download it anywhere else). It’s. Curious to see what you ___?</p>

<p>Get the bonus by recommending any of the above articles on Medium (because that means I get to create more awesome value) - and then reply to this email.</p>

<p>I’ll hit you back with your bonus by later tonight.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>You probably came across a bunch of great links throughout the year. The thing is reading and collecting these links doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>It’s applying the advice inside that will improve your business. That’s why I asked a few of my friends to offer year-end discounts to their flagship products for freelancers.</p>

<p>I’ve compiled those exclusive discounts plus all the best links for improving your consulting in 2015 on this one page called:</p>

<p>PPS. If you’d like to help me share this page, the best way would be to upvote on HN,share on twitter, and upvote on DN. Thanks and happy new year!</p>

<p>Hello. So below is an article I just wrote. I’m sending it to you since you signed up for my weekly newsletter, or an email course of mine. It’s got some actionable ideas for improving your business. </p>

<p>–
Consulting can feel like you’re in a room alone on a treadmill. There’s never an end to the work. You’re alone. The worst part is there’s almost nothing that can fix this except for experience.
That’s why my favorite thing to come out of Workshop has been the community it created. It’s brought people together that have been in your shoes before. They know what it’s like to deal with the problems you have.
In fact, you can take almost any question to them and get a great answer.
Rookies that have never landed a project before are welcome to rub shoulders with world-class consultancy owners. We all ask questions, get advice, and help each other.
This experience is easily more valuable than anything I could’ve ever produced alone. The only problem was, you had to be a member to experience it. In fact, even new members looked at the hundreds of discussions in our community and felt overwhelmed.
After all, there’s hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of advice hidden in it, but finding it all was tough.
Not anymore.
I went through it all myself. Hundreds of threads. Over a year’s worth of questions, answers, resources, tips, and tricks left by some of the best consultants in the world. I sorted out the recurring questions, I found the best answers, and I put it all together for you on one page.
This is one of the most valuable things I’ve ever created. However, I didn’t create it alone. Almost every Workshop member had a part in it. So it felt right to make it available for everyone at no cost.
You can access the new page here: Your biggest questions about freelancing answered 
You’ll find some of freelancing’s biggest questions answered by all different types of freelancers. Even better, it’s all sorted and organized for you to not only find what you’re looking for, but also so that you can come back and refer to it time after time.
Lastly, I spent thousands of dollars of my own money making this available for free. I don’t ask this often, but to continue creating stuff like this, it would mean the world if you’d share this page with anyone you think would benefit. I hope to keep adding to it and making it one of the most valuable pages for freelancers on the internet.
Email me if you would like to add something to it.

<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>Look, I’ve been in your shoes before. I know what it’s like. Freelancing can feel like running on a treadmill. There’s no end in sight to the amount of work you have to put in month in and month out.</p>

<p>Workshop exists because finding work online was a frustrating process.</p>

<p>The typical job board’s goal is to get you to use their site because they need the traffic to stay in business.</p>

<p>Workshop’s goal, on the other hand, is to help you find quality work.</p>

<p>For the past six months, members have worked out of their own inbox. Whenever possible I give members the keys and get out of the way–allowing them to email prospects directly (as opposed to using a form like on most job board sites).</p>

<p>I’ve also invested over ten thousand dollars of my own money into improving the service.</p>

<p>I’ll gladly continue to pay for services and products that improve the quality of my client’s experience, help me find better leads, and allow me to test out new ideas.</p>

<p>I’ve even used Workshop myself, finding my first freelance programmer through the service. Together, we’ve been building an account management app for Workshop. This means we’ll no longer deal with messy account details getting fudged up.</p>

<p>Here’s a sneak peak:</p>

<p>I find it pretty awesome that I was able to use a Workshop member to build the app. After all, he’s going to be paying for and using the app as a client. I hope I can continue hiring Workshop members to work on the app in the future.</p>

<p>A few people have taken notice of the idea behind Workshop, and started copy-cat services. (I’m keeping track of these services in a spreadsheet… last time I checked we were up to 11).</p>

<p>Yes, they may use my writing and steal phrases from my website, but what they can’t copy are the results.</p>

<p>In six months, I’ve had over 30 Workshop-Exclusive leads come in. These projects alone were worth over $100k. Not just that, there’s been 3 members share with me that they’ve made over $100K from the leads I send alone. Since I’m not really able to track who makes what, there’s probably a lot more similar stories out there.</p>

<p>So why can’t these copycat services get the same results? It’s because they use ‘scraping’ or other automated means for finding the leads, hands-free. Workshop, on the other hand, is literally me spending 3+ hours per day checking each lead for quality, and hand-pruning the best ones. In fact, I’ve spent over 360+ hours sorting through the leads alone.</p>

<p>Believe it or not that’s been one of the best parts of starting this service. I’ve learned so much, and I’m able to pass on that knowledge to you each week in the forms of my newsletter and other interactive discussions.</p>

<p>We’ve even began experimenting with a private community for Workshop members that’s yielded more positive results. Through the group, we’ve started masterminds, hosted live interviews, shared knowledge, and even referred work to one another.</p>

<p>The private community has even been testing grounds for new ideas currently in the works like Workshop Premium.</p>

<p>But it all comes back to one philosophy. My clients pay me to send them higher quality leads, more consistently. That’s all I’m here to do and that’s also where we’re going next.</p>

<p>I’ve discussed tons of tactics about how to make more money, how to write better emails, how to improve your portfolio, and how to turn consulting into a product. Now, I’m going to do all of that FOR YOU. I want to bake all of these philosophies and methodologies into Workshop.</p>

<p>Moving forward I’d love to continue hiring Workshop members to build this. Think about it, how awesome would it be to actually pay people to build the software they’re going to pay you to use?</p>

<p>In the immediate next few weeks nothing will be changing, however, the plan is and always will be to send you higher and higher quality leads. That means more customization is on it’s way.</p>

<p>Members: Since I’m not able to track the amount of success you have without being intrusive in your process, I’ve just stayed out of the way. This means I’m kept in the dark about your success. I would really appreciate if you could fill out this survey and let me know what Workshop has done for you.</p>

<p>The best time to followup on a cold email</p>

<p>The best time to followup on a cold email is to follow up numerous times. That’s the only true way to ensure you give yourself the best chance to succeed. Most of the people you contact are just plain busy. They won’t be able to respond right away.</p>

<p>Hey , </p>

<p>You know that email I sent you about exactly how I deleted my portfolio and made more moneh freelancing that year? The reason I shared this experience was because I wanted to share.</p>

<p>When I first published it, that article did amazingly well. that post did really well. I think partly because it a unique and refreshing take. Telling people they didn’t have to do what everyone told them even felt great. </p>

<p>Soon someone had submitted my post to Hacker News and it reached #1 – where it received a positive reception from well-respected people like Brennan Dunn… and over 70K visitors!</p>

<p>Over at Designer News, though, the article was posted to a different reaction. Here too it reached #1 but pretty soon I was banned.</p>

<p>My article was about focusing on the value you were providing and selling that instead of arbitrary work in a portfolio.</p>

<p>Yet I was hell-banned for writing it. (Funnily enough, I learned this on hacker news when the designer news founder commented in my article’s thread.) </p>

<p>This got me searching for somewhere new. I tried hacker news for a while, then dribbble, then /r/freelance on reddit, but it never felt like these communities harbored content that would actually help freelance businesses like mine.  </p>

<p>Anything outside of the normal “techy” news doesn’t get traction. </p>

<p>I wanted to find like-minded freelancers that were eager to help each other. So I built that place. </p>

<p>We created a community for Workshop that was truly vibrant. People shared their secrets and posted some of the most valuable business discussions I’ve had in my entire life.</p>

<p>But then it stalled. It was hard to keep going. Worse, since I had limited to customers of Workshop, it wasn’t helping enough people. </p>

<p>Then the Slack boom happened. Various freelance communities sharing over real-time chat. This too was good for a while. But sooner or later the quality deteriorated. </p>

<p>(As it seems with all slacks). As soon as a discussion started getting valuable and meaty it was off the screen and left to rot in to the Slack archive abyss.</p>

<p>So I kept collecting links that were truly useful for freelancers and sharing them on my twitter, or creating curated lists of the best content for the year, but when it came time to discuss and share new articles I still didn’t have a place to go. </p>

<p>When people would ask me questions I had no where to point them to help find answers. </p>

<p>The reason I used websites like Hacker news and designer news was to find great stuff, cut through the crap, but the more I used them the more it felt like they WERE the crap.</p>

<p>So I decided to create a place for myself. For anyone on this list who would like to participate.</p>

<p>I’ll be sending you more info on this place later this week. </p>

<p>It’s a curated link sharing website with discussion focused on helping you GROW YOUR FREELANCE BUSINESS.</p>

<p>More info to come but for now, if you want to get on the VIP announcement list click here.</p>

<p>Alright here’s what you fucking get when you buy a $399 job post from me.</p>

<p>Yea, I said a $399 job post. Not only will you get my proces for creating an outstanding job post that’s going to attract the top freelacners in the world - me and my team will personally send your project out, review the applicants, find the top three, schedule a 30-minute interview with all three in succession so all you have to do is pay, book a 1:30 slot on your calendar and show up to meet 3 outstanding candidates. No sorting through emails, none of that bullshit buddy/ Let’s get it yeaA!!!</p>

<p>felt rushed “i can start tomorrow” i don’t even know if i want to hire you. or what you would do. or if you’d be tackling the right thing.  you haven’t even tackled the right thing . do you even know anything about my business or the problems you’re trying to solve.</p>

<p>you’re not solving the right problem.</p>

<p>felt like people were just telling me anything i wanted to hear</p>

<p>emails are too long “i dont even want to reply because i know ill get an even longer response if i do”</p>

<p>i felt like people were so vague “what does the thing you are saying you can deliver even mean?” “inside baseball”</p>

<p>not getting at what i care about, too literal too. didn’t relate stuff back to what i need or results i want</p>

<p>too fast to follow up - one follow up in the first week is fine, two in second week.</p>

<p>felt rushed</p>

<p>Hey you know what? Fuck these startups.
These startups that re-market ads with their flash cookies and off-site user behavior tracking — which feeds into their fancy fucking analytic software, building a user profile, pre-opt-in — to make sure I’m segmented into a their most targeted, highly-converting autoresponder group from my first interaction. Why? To maximize some god damn metric so they can be the IPO-ing, VC-seeking, .IO-buying, IP monetizing and NDA growth-hacking piece of shit company they are. Fuck them.</p>

<p>The Average Website
When you arrive at the average website, most of the time you know what you’re going to see. Probably an opt-in form. A latest blog post. Some big screenshot of a product with a headline reading “the best way to do X”.
You’re also probably going to see some sort of pop-up pop up. Either a drip widget or a welcome mat or some other equally annoying thing that you’ll have to quickly get rid of.
You’ll probably see a sidebar with an opt-in widget or two and social share buttons that follow you around. You’ll see a contact and about link and a flurry of widgets and overlays rotating and blinking in and out of sight. All of this in an effort to maximize, optimize, advertise, and monetize the average website.
These are all obvious standards that the average website would be a fool to ignore. After all, they’ve been put in place after much trial and error.
Each one is guaranteed to get the average website the highest number of conversions, subscribers, or visitors possible.
But the funny part is that after you implement all of this and create the most ideal web design for the average website. That’s what you’re left with.
A VERY AVERAGE WEBSITE.</p>
