		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">How to create an email course for prospective clients</h1>
    <p>Email courses are one of the best business assets you can create for your business. As we covered in the last lesson, they give your prospects advice, share valuable information, and built trust, and BEST of all it all happens automatically.</p>

<p>Now we’re going to talk about how to setup a email course, how to write it, and how to get future clients to sign up. The first thing you’re going to need is an actual course.</p>

<p>Don’t be intimidated by the word course. If you can deliver $500+ worth of value to a client (if you can design, write, or code, you can do this easily) THEN you can write a fantastic email course.</p>

<p>In fact, you’ve probably already written your course without knowing. A great place to find material for your email course is your blog. Often client service professionals have a blog talking about their expertise.</p>

<p>If you’ve written about something in your industry, don’t overcomplicate things insert that into your email course.</p>

<p>Another place you should look for content that’ll go into your email course will be your past work. Look at your portfolio, case studies, and past projects. What lessons can you pull out of the work you’ve done? Create short 1-2k word articles out of past work you’ve done. This is</p>

<p>An example might be you did a project for a client where you were expecting to do one thing but ended up doing something completely different and it worked out great. This is something a client will not only learn from but it will help illustrate how much expertise you have.</p>

<p>It doesn’t even have to be a successful project. You can talk about a challenging project, sometimes these are the projects where you learn the most. Talk about something you’ve struggled with. Talk about a project where you had great results.</p>

<p>All that really matters is that you talk about a project where you picked something up. Added something to your repertoire.</p>

<p>Yet another way you can come up with material to include in an email course is by recording consultation calls with potential clients. This is probably the best way to create content that clients care about. Record a Skype call or phone call with a client using something like skype recorder, then jot down all the questions, concerns, and comments that your clients have.</p>

<p>Then take these questions and write them down. Order them in a way that makes sense, and write down answers for each one. This is great because you’re not only creating useful things you wouldn’t have come up with by yourself… YOU’RE guaranteed that it hits home with your clients. It’ll be content that’s absolutely on the mind of your potential clients! Even better yet it will make your sales calls better because you’ll have thought about these questions before and you can even use the writing to followup with clients who have the same questions.</p>

<p>This type of backwards building is how you create assets in your business.</p>

<p>So we’ve talked about 3 ways you can create content but for it to really hit home you’ll need a tested structure for delivering it. Here’s where you use the Value Sandwich.</p>

<p>Upon signing up to your list, you first send your clients a welcome email. Next you follow that up with 2 valuable, educational emails this makes them know who you are, and immediately begins the relationship off with a burst of value. They know who you are and they know you know what you’re doing. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>By delivering value to the client before they even jump on a call with you, or you even begin the sales process, they’re not only establishing you as an expert, they’re building trust with you. Your’e making it clear that you have their best interest in mind. All without you even spending a single minute on it. All for free.</p>

<p>Next, after you’ve given them this value you’re going to want to step up the relationship. I recommend a pre-recorded webinar with a call to action that has them fill out your qualifying form on your website (we’re going to talk about optimizing this form on your site next).</p>

<p>This will make so much sense. There’s this person they signed up for their email list, immediately got value from, established they’re an expert, clearly are not only able to help their business but in fact have ALREADY improved their business just by giving away free information.</p>

<p>Now, this person is offering to basically give a free consultation that shares his best secrets. (Make sure to promise you’ll share something awesome on the webinar).</p>

<p>That’s a deal you’d be a fool to turn down. Not many clients can come to turn down this type of offer.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of all of this is that it’s completely 100% no pressure. You’re not going sleazy for hard-sale tactics. You’re not pressuring anyone into anything. All you’re doing is delivering value to your clients. You’re giving them a free preview. The same way Costco gives you a free sample, or Basecamp, or that Gelato place.</p>

<p>Small bite-sized taste testers that make the client say UHHHH yes please. That’s what you want to deliver in your email course. You can deliver this in a variety of ways. Start with video. That’s the one that’s going to have the biggest return. Why? Actually hearing and seeing a live person talking to you is just so damn powerful. Why do you think I do it in my videos. Once you know I’m a real person who can talk to you and put my face on a video you know I’m for real. I’m here for the long-term.</p>

<p>So one last thing we haven’t talked about. How do you get people on your email list anyway. This is what w’ere going to cover in the next lesson. (It’s not how you think). Let’s jump in.</p>
