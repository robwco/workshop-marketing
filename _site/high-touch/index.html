		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">Automating "High-touch" Sales</h1>
    <p>Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I’ve sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p>Some examples of automation include: <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">Workshop’s long form sales page</a> which does a great job of anticipating and answering most questions. It also lets you sign up for a free course that drips more information into your inbox. Plus, I have a <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/advice">new FAQ</a> that answers Workshop + other related questions.</p>

<p>But still some people prefer to talk to a real person. They rather open up their email and fire over a quick question. I get that. Instead of trying to stop these tire-kickers, I decided to use a years worth of knowledge to answer their questions in a way that felt like I was writing to them but was 100% automated.</p>

<p>In practice this meant someone could send me their question, and get an automated answer back from me. Sort of like a create your own adventure book. I was able to do this with <a href="http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555">automation feature in Drip</a>, using ideas from Patrick McKenzie’s recent email: <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation">Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing this system has been one of the biggest wins for me (and my inbox) this year. Here’s what the process looks like:</p>

<p><strong>When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-welcome.png" alt="Workshop's Course Welcome Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve used this email before (without the links at the end) and it always got a high reply rate. But now even people who don’t have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. This is also where a years-worth of (at times brain-numbing) customer service paid off.  I came up with these 4 options because I knew it always came down to those 4. Note: I don’t keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback, it simply triggers a follow-up email.</p>

<p><strong>Clicking on one of the options triggers a one-off email that addresses their feedback:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: RE: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-followup.png" alt="Workshop's Course Follow-up Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve gotten a huge response rate to this email, because it feels so real – mostly because IT IS REAL. It’s exactly what I would say to one of those objections. It’s me.</p>

	<p>Does it feel like clients expect near-instant gratification at all times? That type of client relationship kills your productivity and work-life balance... leaving you feeling burnt out.</p>
