		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Welcome to Workshop!</h1>
    <h2 id="hello-and-welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-finding-clients">Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of finding clients!</h2>
<p>Okay maybe finding clients isn’t so wonderful sometimes. In fact, it’s mostly just a time-consuming pain in the butt.</p>

<p>But that’s why you’ve hired me. All day long you work with clients. They get to tell you what <em>they</em> want and <em>you</em> get to deliver them results.</p>

<h2 id="now-its-your-turn-to-be-the-client">Now it’s your turn to be the client.</h2>
<p>And I want to do everything in my power to deliver YOU results.</p>

<p>The first step is this welcome packet. Please consider it a personal thank you gift for signing up for Workshop.</p>

<p>I’ve loaded it up with as many valuable goodies as possible to get you off on the right foot.</p>

<h2 id="ive-built-workshop-for-one-reason-to-help-you-make-more-money">I’ve built Workshop for one reason: to help you make more money.</h2>
<p>I believe you’re already on the right path. Soon you’ll be boosting your revenue and ending the feast or famine cycle forever.</p>

<p>How? By reaching out to new clients daily. This is an excellent way to find new freelance projects for your business. In fact, if you reach out to just one job in every Workshop email,  you’ll have contacted 20 potential new projects in just one month.</p>

<p>Combined, that equals less than an hour of work per month in exchange for potentially earning tens of thousands. In fact, a few Workshop rockstars have closed six figure deals in their first few months. (Talk about return on investment.)</p>

<h1 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h1>

<h2 id="your-leads-will-start-arriving-shortly">Your leads will start arriving shortly.</h2>
<p>You’ll get the first few over email in the next hour along with periodic check-ins and tips from me in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>The daily email containing about 8-10 of the latest freelance leads will arrive every weekday at 8:00 AM EST.</strong></p>

<p>I hope you email those leads as soon as you get them no matter what!</p>

<p>See, you might be fully-booked right now, and although that seems like it’ll last a long time - the truth is dry spells happen because freelancers often don’t look for work when they should (like when they’re already fully booked).</p>

<p>That’s why I recommend if you’re not booked 6-months in advance, you email at least one new lead every day. Even if it’s not a lead you found on Workshop.</p>

<h1 id="what-ill-be-doing-for-you">What I’ll be doing for you</h1>

<h2 id="im-finding-you-the-best-freelance-leads">I’m finding you the best freelance leads</h2>
<p>I use a little bit of custom software and a ton of elbow grease to go through the web and find you potential clients. I use a custom built rss reader, a gigantic list of freelancer sites, and more levers and systems to keep track of everything everyday.</p>

<p>My small team and I find leads in the very best freelance job boards like Authentic Jobs, Dribbble, Hacker News threads, and more. This means the opportunities you receive are public. This is a good thing because they’re readily expecting to receive emails from freelancers.</p>

<p>I wont send you anything from Elance or a similar job boards because those are usually 1) not open to the public (meaning you have to sign in and compete on their websites to see them) or 2) really low quality (meaning they wont be good clients).</p>

<p>The amount of time it takes to find these is really what you’re paying for. On average you’ll save over 10 hours per week. This is not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Added up, that’s a 5-10x savings for you based on your hourly rate.</p>

<p>If you see a low-competition lead come in (with a green ‘low-competition’ label indicator), that means it’s someone who’s come to Workshop to find a freelancer. These are usually the best people to email because there’s almost no competition.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-lead">What makes a good lead?</h2>
<p>​The leads you’ll be receiving are 100% organic, gluten-free grass-fed beef. (Sorry if you’re hungry now). What I’m trying to say (poorly) is that the leads I find are from public places. They’re people actually looking for a freelancer at the moment.</p>

<p>This means they’re clients who realize they need help and already have a project in mind. This makes them much better than “cold leads” who a lot of freelancers contact out of the blue, without knowing if they’re even interested.</p>

<p>A good lead boils down to someone who needs a problem solved. It doesn’t matter what your specialty is, if you can solve a problem for a client they don’t care if you do it in ruby, php, or klingon.</p>

<p>Freelancers can get hung up on the fact that they specialize in X and forget the fact that this means nothing to 99% of people on earth.</p>

<p>And sometimes a client won’t understand the difference between a Wordpress website and a Ruby app. It’s your responsibility to decide what the right solution is, regardless of what they’re asking for.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-wont-get">What you won’t get</h2>
<p>I’m going to be real honest with you. You are not ever going to receive the absolute ideal client from me. Why? Because  the perfect client doesn’t exist. There will never be a lead that checks off every thing you want to see in a client.</p>

<p>The truth is we create ideal clients by working with them. By educating them. By demanding them.</p>

<p>Only working with great clients is something I’m a huge proponent of. However, the leads I send - and any leads really - are all focused on one thing: getting the most successful project. Regardless of what their budget says, you can help these leads.</p>

<p>The truth is most clients honestly don’t know what it takes to create the right solution. Everyone wants a deal, and to get the lowest price on something. However, if you’re able to show them why it’s in their best interest to pay more there’s not a single client in the world who won’t open up their wallet.</p>

<p>They all have a problem they want solved. You’re ahead of most because you’ve paid to have these people brought to you. You value your time.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to give clients what they value. Stop focusing on what clients say they want. Make it about improving their life.</p>

<p>When you do this, the specifics, like they think their budget is, will melt away.
See, this opens you up to more clients, but it also makes you more valuable. It makes you a consultant, valued for your mind just as much as your hands.</p>

<p>That’s why I suggest you stay signed up and push yourself to contact at least one new opportunity every day, regardless of if it’s your ideal lead. Even if you think they can’t afford you.</p>

<p>Instead of writing off clients that you think you aren’t right for, propose a solution that shows you are. This is how top freelancers get clients to 10x their budgets. By showing them what they need, not what they ask for.</p>

<h1 id="before-you-reply-to-any-leads-i-send-you-read-this">Before you reply to any leads I send you, read this</h1>
<p>You know there are bad clients out there. But consider for a second that it must be tough for clients too.</p>

<p>They’re tossed into the web world that even professional designers and developers don’t fully understand.</p>

<p>They hire someone to create, in a few weeks or months of work, something that their business will depend on every day, forever.</p>

<p>Long after you are working on the next project, they’re still using with what you made for them.</p>

<p>We’ve all heard client horror stories shared on Twitter or websites like Clients From Hell that tell the side from a freelancer’s perspective. Now it’s time to share the other side.</p>

<p>My friend Loren owns a sushi catering business in Oceanside, California. It’s called the Sushi Bus, because every weekday, he packs up his business and drives somewhere new to sell sushi.</p>

<p>It’s a small business, but he’s able to live off the money he makes. His typical work day is 12 hours long. He works 12 pm - 12 am. He doesn’t have much free time.</p>

<p>Instead, his team of chefs focuses solely on the art of sushi. They masterfully infuse Mexican, North American, and Vietnamese recipes into their dishes. They are true masters of their craft and dedicate more time to their work than any freelancer I’ve known. Loren barely has time to check his email.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a thriving business. Dozens of people ask every day how they can find out where the Sushi Bus will be next. Customers literally pull out their phones and hand them to Loren, asking to follow the Sushi Bus on Twitter. The problem is, they don’t have an online presence. The Sushi Bus isn’t on Twitter.</p>

<p>So, Loren decided to change that. He did some homework and researched how to get a website built. He posted the job on a freelance board and was soon inundated with replies from website designers and developers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t tell them apart. Every email included portfolio and website links, resumes, phone numbers, and more. The applicants used words like conversion rate, wordpress, pixel-perfection, content, online presence, and email marketing. Words he didn’t understand.</p>

<p>Some of the emails were so long that Loren didn’t even have time to read them. He was left contemplating his options. He didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Had even one freelancer mentioned how a great website could open new doors for his business, Loren would have been interested. All he needed to hear was that a mailing list would instantly tell hundreds of hungry fans where to find his bus during their lunch breaks.</p>

<p>… And Loren would’ve invested immediately. This would have made total sense  and he would’ve happily opened his wallet, knowing he would make the money back every time he sent out one of these emails.</p>

<p>See, Loren knew a website could help, but he didn’t know how. He didn’t know, because no one told him.</p>

<p>Instead, all the freelancers spoke a foreign language. He felt excluded. He felt like an outsider. His business, his livelihood, and his potential all suffered that day.</p>

<p>If you replied to his job post, you missed out on a great client.</p>

<h1 id="so-whats-the-right-way-to-email-a-lead">So, what’s the right way to email a lead?</h1>

<h2 id="the-cold-email-checklist">The Cold Email Checklist:</h2>
<p>Before you hit send on an email, make sure what you’re sending is good.</p>

<p>A lot of freelancers get hung up on what they should say to a new prospect. Staring at a blank screen can be a horrible feeling.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve developed this cold email checklist after studying thousands of ignored emails and why they didn’t get responses.</p>

<p>The first step is to just dive in and write a quick, short rough draft email to your prospect. For more help with that, check out my book: Emails That Win You Clients.</p>

<p>Once you have your first draft email written, you can apply a few quick rules to it to make sure you’re maximizing your response rate:</p>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/subject.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The subject line should be so specific it could only be sent to one person in the world.</h3>
<p>This will make sure your email gets opened because busy people look to remove spam first.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/length.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The length of a cold email should be under 120 words.</h3>
	<p>Busy people don't have time to read much. Make it simple, crisp, and get to the point.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/value.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> Your email should provide something of value.</h3>
	<p>Would you be happy to receive this email, even if you had no intention of hiring someone? Delivering advice or tips is an easy way to show you're on the client's side.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/social.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> Don't include links to your social media or portfolio.</h3>
	<p>A prospective client doesn't really care about your work... at least not yet. The only point of this first email is to get them to reply so making them click on your website, linkedin profile or portfolio doesn't help you.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/clarity.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> It should be easy to find the point of your email.
	</h3>
	<p>Someone using a job board probably has a lot of email responses and is more likely to scan and look for the next step. Make that part of your email easy to find. Bold it if you have to.</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 5px solid #2996bf; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/images/checklist/reply.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0 1em 0 0; border-radius: .25em;" />
	<h3 style="margin: 1em 0 .5em 0;"><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: #36b744;"></i> The end of your email should be easy to reply to in seconds.
	</h3>
	<p>You don't want to give a busy lead more work. If the lead can say "sounds good" you're probably on the right track.</p>

<h1 id="your-primary-contact-person-is-julie">Your primary contact person is Julie</h1>
<p>I like providing the absolute best service available anywhere. To do that I’ve built a team that will help you build your freelance business.</p>

<p>Your personal email-writing concierge is Julie Elster. She’s written for me in the past, spoken at the Double Your Freelance Conference, and has a great service that helps freelancers get paid faster called Just Tell Julie.</p>

<p>If you run into any questions, need help thinking something out, or anything else email her directly for the fastest response time:</p>

<p>julie@letsworkshop.com</p>

<h1 id="my-availability-to-you">My availability to you</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in the last section, Julie is your main point of contact with the service. I’m super excited to offer her expertise to you and her email writing services alone are worth your entire subscription cost.</p>

<p>I work Monday through Friday, between 9am and 5pm Pacific Time. If you email me outside of those times, I might not respond as quickly as usual. Also, I only meet during business hours. See how my time zone lines up with yours.</p>

<p>Like everybody, I also take vacation from time to time. You will continue to receive leads when I’m on vacation as long as it’s not a national holiday. However, I will most likely not be as easy to get a hold of during this time. I take vacation time really seriously and think it’s crucial in maintaining a high level of service for you.</p>

<p>Like most folks, I also take a few holidays off. Expect intermittent availability around most American holidays, especially Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, MLK Day, my birthday (February 01), Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day – and no leads on these days either.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to hear about everything you like and dislike about using Workshop. Clients like you are my lifeblood and it’s crucial to hear what you think.</p>

<p>If you need assistance click here to email me at robert@letsworkshop.com or call me personally at  760-693-3360.</p>

<p>Looking forward to having you as a customer!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Robert
