		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Re-writing a headline</h1>
    <p>My website’s design is beautiful, but it isn’t growing my business.
Elliot responded to my 2-minute design challenge email a few weeks ago because his website, Brightalyze, was in need of some help.
It receives compliments left and right, but is not converting — and the project was losing money as a result.
It’s a classic example of how design is not always the most important thing when it comes to web projects. That facts are; 90% of the web is type — and although the site was sleek and pretty, it was still out of touch with the pain-points of people visiting the site.
Since most people visiting a website will only ever see the headline, that’s what we’ll be focusing on when discussing how to improve this site.
It does a great job of looking like an established and trust-worthy company, both benefits of good branding. However, branding does not inspire people to try out a service, it only makes you not discount the company immediately.
Ultimately what will cause people to try the service is the offering.
The headline reads, “Create the World’s Next Great App”.
And the sub-head supports with, “Brightalyze helps with challenges of development, so you can relax.”
At first, these two sentences seem like they’re answering solid pain points for the user. However, if we dig a little deeper the truth is they are both quite vague.
For example, we don’t get answers to how will Brightalyze do these things, and why are they better than an established competitor at doing these things? We don’t even get answers to what exactly the service is, is it an iphone app, a web app, an online course, a concierge service etc.?
I didn’t know the answer to these questions either, so I asked Elliot. His response was, “We provide project management to incubate the project, that other services do not.”
That is actually a great selling point, and valuable service, much better than saying a blanket generic statement about ‘creating the world’s next great app’.
However, it’s not answering what pain it is solving.
So, how do you find what pain your product is solving? Would you believe me if I said that great wallet-bursting copywriting doesn’t happen in your head? It actually comes from your clients mouths. They are constantly talking about what they like and don’t like in public places (especially online).
To find this you simply need to search for the pain. It could be a reddit thread on r/freelance, it could be the comments of a blog article, it could even be in conversation with a client… but one of the best places to find these pain quotes is Amazon.
If you look at books on your topic, than look at the reviews for that book (particularly the 5 star and 1 star sections) you will find a great list of pains and delights that you can reverse-engineer to create beautiful copy.
The best part is you wont have to do too much work to make the messages resonate with your customer, because you are already using their words!
A quick Amazon review query resulted in various different pain points for freelance design clients, including:
	•	“I spent hours sifting through hundreds of Dribbble profiles”
	•	“When you work with a freelancer, you’re gambling.”
	•	“I just can’t relax and trust them.”
	•	“Design is often a failed effort at organizations.”
	•	“Finding a designer was like mining for gold.”
	•	“Design is a differentiating factor, but I just can’t nail it”
	•	“You hire a guy to design your website… and three months later nothing.”
How’s that for pain? Who knew the design profession was causing so many late nights for so many people. There’s literally thousands more pain points on amazon just waiting to me mined.
What do all of these pains deal with? Uncertainty. Stress. Trust. Time-wasting.
These are all things that Brightalyze can help with. Does “Create the World’s Next Great App” get that across? No.
I’ll be sending Elliot my suggestions for what the headline should say, but I also want to hear from you. If this was your site, what would you say in your headline?
How would you combine these pain points with his service offering of “project management that incubates projects?” Reply to this email and I’ll pass along the message.
