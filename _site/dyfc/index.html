<section class="tight-wrap" style="margin: 3em auto;">
<p>Hey there! Brennan and I created this special sign up page for you. It’s a 60-day free trial on my freelance-client-finding service, Workshop.</p>

<p><strong>Lining up new work is critical… but you’ve already got a business to run.</strong> Finding leads is labor-intensive and a poor use of your time. Worse, neglecting it causes holes in your pipeline and you run into constant dry spells known as feast or famine freelancing. You wish you could clone yourself and have another you that focused only on finding new work opportunities. </p>

<p>That’s what you can do with Workshop (not clone yourself exactly… but close!). </p>

<p>Imagine never having to hunt for work again. Overnight your clone would toil away finding new gigs for you. When you woke up your inbox would be ready with eager potential clients ready to work with you. Instead of sifting through thousands of gigs on job boards, elance, twitter, and everywhere else online –&nbsp;they were all presorted, and filed neatly in your inbox. You could be on top of every opportunity and best of all, you could go through them in a matter of minutes. <strong>Finally, you could give your sales funnel the attention it deserves, and focus on winning clients instead of finding them.</strong></p>

<p>That’s Workshop. Sign up below and you’ll get the web's best freelance opportunities delivered to your inbox every morning for the next 2 months absolutely free. Combining Workshop with the DYFC course will produce huge results for you, that's why we created this 60-day free trial. You’ll get over 400 leads in this time if you sign up below and claim your spot before April 2nd.</p>

	<h3>This is a special deal that Brennan asked me to create for you on my lead-generation service for freelancers and consultancies.</h3> 
	<p style="font-size: 14px;">Each day I send the 10+ best leads on the web to a tiny newsletter of world-class consultants. Every one of these leads has been hand-picked and inspected to make sure it fits the following criteria, they must be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>100% freelance consulting gigs or short-term projects.</li>
		<li>Worth $1,000+ in freelance work.</li>
		<li>Open to freelancers anywhere and 100% remote work.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 14px;">In fact, this week alone I've sent out over $126,900 worth of freelance work. Although it usually costs $64/month to be on this list, today I have a special limited time offer exclusively for students of Double Your Freelancing Clients.</p>	
	
<h3>Get a 60-day free trial (400+ leads) now.</h3> 
<p style="font-size: 14px;">This offer is not available anywhere else and will expire on April 2nd 2015. I'll never offer a deal like this again so sign up below.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></p> 
<p style="font-size: 14px;">I know that combined with the techniques in Brennan's book, this subscription will produce a huge return on investment for you and I'm so confident I'm willing to back it up with a 30-day free trial.</p>-->

<h2>Thousands of businesses are looking for someone to make them a website, so why is it so hard to find work?</h2>

<p>It's because finding these businesses isn't exactly easy. You're already working too much. You have to check important emails, fix billing issues, and put out fires in your business. Doing lead generation on top of everything sucks. Checking job boards every day, or worse: elance, just isn't the best use of your time and you know it. After all, you want to do the work you love, not search for it. That's why you wait for work to come to you (read: do nothing).</p>

<p>But Instead of complaining about bad clients, what if you fired them? If instead of getting low-balled you took only the projects that valued you and paid you what you're worth? What if you never worried about dry spells and knew exactly where your next project was going to come from?</p>

<h2>You can kiss <strong>feast or famine consulting</strong> goodbye.</h2>

<p>It's time to do something about the holes in your sales funnel. You know your business needs access to all of the best opportunities out there. It doesn't matter if they're on twitter, a job board, or some other site... great clients deserve to have access to your company's services and expertise.</p>

<p>But how? You know you can't be everywhere at once. You can't even imagine finding all of these opportunities yourself,  how are you going to also make time to contact them? You can't. You just need them delivered to you. That way, you can focus on selling your company, the thing you KNOW you can do – the thing you want to focus on.</p>

<h2>Imagine what you could accomplish if you weren't worried about finding work.</h2>

<p>If you woke up every day with a dozen great clients looking for help what would it mean to your business? Would your revenue double? Would it turn your on-the-side freelancing into a six-or-seven-figure consultancy?</p>

<p>If, overnight, you stopped wasting time looking for work and got the best consulting clients sent to you instead? If you could simply reply to people and projects you were excited to work for, straight from your inbox? If it took minutes (instead of hours) to fill your sales pipeline each morning and you got to focus exclusively on billable work?</p>

<p>What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client's project and blow them away? Would you use the free time to go on a walk and clear your head? Or maybe you'd build that side-project you've been itching to work on?</p>

<h2>Let me send you the best leads on the web.</h2>

<p>You might think this setup is impossible. However, for hundreds of consultancies it's a reality. I've created a hands-free lead generation service for consultancies looking to make more money building websites. From the day you sign up, you receive the highest quality leads on the web. Every opportunity from every nook and cranny on the web, pre-qualified and sorted into your inbox.</p>

<p>It's also super affordable. Even if you're a freelancer, you can easily take advantage of my offer. It's the cost of a cup of coffee every day.</p>

<p>But you're not buying a membership to Workshop because it's cheap, you're buying one because you know it works. You're buying it because it's the best thing for you can do for your business.</p>

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<p>Your subscription gets you a daily email with the best leads from all over the web. <strong>This equals to over 2400 leads per year.</strong> You also join a limited group of consultancy owners getting leads that are posted only on Workshop – and nowhere else. These are five and six figure budget projects sent only to a handful of freelancers and agencies who have decided to focus on improving their business. If you reach out to a few of these opportunities every day you'll make thousands of dollars every month.</p>

<h1>There's zero risk for the first 30 days. Get over 200 great leads for free.</strong></h1>

<p>Like you, I know there are a ton of businesses who will benefit from working with me. That's why I'm making it a no-brainer by offering you a full refund if you're not completely blown away in the first thirty days.</p>

<h2>So what happens if I don't like it?</h2>

<p>No worries. There's a 30-day 100% satisfaction guarantee. Enjoy Workshop for a full month, and if you don't like it for any reason, send me an email and I'll give you a refund. I don't want your money if you're not 100% blown away.</p>

<h2>"How many leads will be sent, and how often?"</h2>

<p>I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes more, <strong>but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads.</strong> I never send a lead just to hit a quota. In fact, Workshop's value is equally about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important.</p>

<h2>"Do you send my specific type of lead?"</h2>

<p>Right now Workshop is mostly focused on web design and development. However, we have a steady amount of other leads coming in like mobile development, illustration, brand design, and other stuff. The best way to find out if Workshop has what you need is to sign up and see for yourself. I can also send you a sample email if you give me your email address using the form at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>"How long have you been doing this, does it work?"</h2>

<p>I started doing this with select consultancies in November, 2013. Since then I've helped hundreds land work. Some have even made hundreds of thousands of dollars from my leads. Now, I focus on Workshop full-time, which wouldn't be possible if it didn't produce massive results for my customers.</p>
