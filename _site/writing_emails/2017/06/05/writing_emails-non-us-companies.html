    <p>How do you improve your chances as a firm outside the US looking to land clients? Here’s my tips for you on the way that I would approach companies in the US as an outside firm.</p>

<p>I’m going to give you some very straight forward advice - others would sugar coat it but I’m not going to - I’m just going to tell you with no BS what you’re doing wrong.</p>

<p>First, here’s a few quick things that I would change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Never use “Greetings” just say “Hello” or use their first name. “Greetings” sounds like an alien bot and people will immediate think you are spam.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would shorten your name in gmail to just use Vlad Federov. Vlad is more common here and so western clients will be more familiar with it and more comfortable with you. Look, I know this is not fair or right, but it will probably get you better results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t want to say you do it all. This comes off extremely unprofessional. Instead you want to be world-class at one hyper-focused thing. In this scenario they’re looking for someone great at publishing and marketing. you need to focus your email on this specific need of theirs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t include quotes, unless they’re from the head of very well known companies - they won’t get read anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve never heard the expression “no underwater rocks”. I don’t think this is common. 
Your email is too long. You are coming off pushy, and like you are rushing to the sale when you have not established a need yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Name
When you send off an email the recipient is only going to have 2 ways to get information about you to decide if htey shoudl open the meail. Your subject line and your name. My recommendation is to make your name something that is recognizable. This might seem weird so if you re uncomfortable with it i understand, but I’m just here to give you tips that will help improve your response and open rate. So, for example, you could go by Mat Ross. A common nickname here in the US is Mat so people are used to seeing that name. That’s a name that wouldn’t raise suspicision on my end of anythign and you jsut seem normal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t bring up that you’re a foreign company pre-maturely
Think of this like dating. When you’re courting someone you don’t bring up your faults (or something that you’re not sure they will perceive as a fault) atleast not until you’ve established a connection. You want to put your best foot forward, you don’t want to lie or keep the information frmo them especially if they ask. But you also don’t want to bring it up in the first email when there is no need. (That said, of course you want to tell them at some point. My recommendation is you do this on a call.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the phrase “with past clients…”
If a client brings up the fact that you’re outside of the country as a concenr, one of the best ways to ease their concern is to use the phrase “with past clients in your timezone,  we found that being available and leaving an overlap of 3 hours every workday was actually more than enough. In fact, in a lot of ways it was actually better for them because they got to wake up to fresh work and it let them be more productive.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make english a priority
If you send me your emails I can almost gaurantee that I will be able to find some errors in your grammar. Its simply difficult to write perfect American english unless you’re completely native to the US.It’s also an easy way for companies to rationalize not responding to your email. Your english needs to be spotless at the beginning of the courtin gprocess. A lot of startups and firms in the us willl be able to spot weird colloquiialisms that don’t trasnalte from a mile away. This is one of the most common errors i asee frmo non-us based companies when pitching. You need to make sure there are not only no errors in grammmar but also no wierd phrases and other things. That make you seem out of place in thier inbox . I consider hiring someone to read this. And send emails on your behald. Bonuse points inf they’re in the usa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t pitch yourself as a cheaper option
Even if you are infact cheaper you don’t want to sell pbased on a lower price. Instead you want to offer more better services. That is more incentivizing to people to know they can get more done than they can dsave a few bvucks. This will attract bad clients who just want the lowest price anyway. Not the type of clients you’er looking for. This also comes off as kind of scammy on your end like you’re desperate and you’ll say anything you need to make the sale.</p>
