  <p>Hello [X],</p>

  <p>[Flattery] I’ve just seen the redesign of your website and it’s brilliant – especially [list a specific feature/function].</p>

  <p>[Context] I’m web designer and I was wondering if I could ask you a few quick questions to learn more about how I could best serve your industry.</p>

  <p>[Getting to the point quickly] You are definitely a leader in your field, so I’d love to learn what I can – any answers will be kept in the strictest of confidence.
1. What lead you to hiring someone to redesign your website?
2. What results did you expect?
3. How did you find the web designer you hired and why did you hire them?</p>

  <p>I appreciate your time and I look forward to hearing back from you,</p>

  <p>Frank</p>

  <p>Hi Frank,</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Our website was outdated and we weren’t able to update it ourselves. Most of our clients also visit our site from mobile devices and it wasn’t responsive.</li>
    <li>We wanted more signups to our firm’s newsletter, which leads to clients hiring us.</li>
    <li>We found Paul (the designer) because he answered a question we had on twitter. 
After seeing his portfolio and feeling like his style was a match for our brand, we hired him.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Cheers,</p>

  <p>Ms. Lawyer</p>

  <p>I’ve used a freelancer who does a good job at following directions. I decided to just lay everything out myself [wireframes] and hire a freelancer to design it and a freelancer to chop it up and make it work.</p>

<h2 id="most-people-think-cold-emails-are-about-what-you-say-theyre-wrong-heres-what-they-are-actually-about">Most people think cold emails are about what you SAY, they’re wrong, here’s what they ARE actually about</h2>

<p>Cold emails aren’t about what you say, here’s what they ARE about</p>

<p>Most people believe the most important thing about writing emails is the writing, they’re wrong</p>

<p>So it makes sense right. When you open up your email editor to write something you’re faced with a blank screen. Of course that’s intimidating. You open it up, maybe start writing a few sentences, but before you know if you’ve deleted and rewritten the email more than a dozen times.</p>

<p>This experience leads us all to believe that what really matters is the words we send. If we just send the magic key email with the secret passphrase it’ll unlock the client work. Every client has a project safe word that if they hear they’ll instantly spread open their wallet for.</p>

<p>If that sounds ridiculous that’s because it is. Yet most freelancers believe that! That’s the only real feedback loop we get. Our minds tell us the only difference between email 1 and email 2 are the contents. The truth is that just under the surface there’s difference, subtle yet powerful.</p>

<p>Now, let’s not throw writing completely out of the window. It’s not that simple. If you write a 4k word email that takes months to read you probably won’t hear back. And you can dramatically increase the amount of replies you get by simply avoiding a few other common mistakes like ending your emails with “let me know…” I cover ALL of the mistakes later in the course.</p>

<p>However, what I’ve found to be the true MOST important factor in winning work through cold client outreach is actually something that’s unseen in most cases.</p>

<p>Timing.</p>

<p>Not only is timing not as conscious of a decision as the words we use, it’s nearly invisible when you factor in that it’s completely unique to the client. The mindset, the literal time in their locale, the stage of the buying cycle for the client all of these things have a greater affect on whether they decide to hire you than what you write in your email.</p>

<p>Now I’ve written a book on writing great emails so I’m not here to tell you what to do, I believe a great email improves your chances greatly, I’m just here to tell you what works.</p>

<p>Now we just said, timing is nearly invisible to you. So how can you even account for timing? Well it’s impossible to get every single email perfectly timed, that’s true. But you can maximize the effectiveness of your emails by accounting for just a few different timing challenges.</p>

<p>The first timing challenge is busy overload. If a client is overloaded with other work, other applicants, other things going on then the chances that this is the right time to send them an email are REALLy really low. He’s likely drowning to catch up with his work, not looking to respond to your email.</p>

<p>The next timing challenge is buying cycle. The client might not be ready to buy from you because they’re not ready to buy from anyone. They’re simply not at t point where hiring someone makes sense… yet.</p>

<p>The next timing challenge might literally be the time. If a client checks their email in the morning but you send it at night their time then you probably won’t get your email read until the following morning if at all. The chances they reply go down with how long it takes them to get to it.</p>

<p>The answer to all of these challenges is sending multiple emails. Following up. Most people never do this, so they never get the right to be heard. They send a one-off email and they expect people to flock to them. As I’ve demonstrated this simply isn’t going to win you enough work. You’ll constantly be fighting off one of these timing struggles. You’ll get lost int the shuffle of the busy, the time, or the buying cycle.</p>

<p>If you send more than one email though, your chances of getting through dramatically increase. In fact they double :D because you’re giving yourself a chance to break through the timing issues.</p>

<p>Now probably the best part about all of these is that you can automate it so simply so that al you have to do is send the one off email and automatically you’ll also be scheduling a follow up campaign to get sent however often you like for as long as you like.</p>

<p>Not bad right? There’s a few different options you have for email providers but the one I’ll use in this example is Quickmail.io I recommend you use quickmail.</p>

<p>Use my 5x5 approach for all your outreach sending a total of at least 5 email followups to your original email and you use at least 5-day wait period between followups.</p>

<p>This will mean you truly get the most out of the emails you send. I’ve seen similar campaigns like the one linked in the lesson notes get a 40% response rate. Why? Because this campaign takes account for the most important aspect: timing.</p>

<p>You see what you think of as spammy or annoying is actually the most considerate thing you can do. (Clients will actually tell you that even after the 5th email you send them “oh wow thanks so much for following up with me I’ve been out of town but this is really important so I appreciate it”)</p>

<p>The 5x5 technique protects you from over-doing it. 5 days is the minimum amount of time you should wait before you send another followup email to someone. You don’t want to be too quick because then you come off as needy. You want to be cool calm and persistent. By calmly following up every 5-10 days, you’re showing you not only understand that the client buying process is rocky and that they’re busy people , you’re also showing you can be counted on to do what it takes to move forward.</p>

<p>It’s the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Hi Rob</p>

<p>Hope yo pare good?</p>

<p>Just wondering if you can help me out? </p>

<p>I wouldn’t normally do this as it feels a bit cheeky, but I would really appreciate your help and advice here.</p>

<p>After buying your’ emails’ book and reading it through several times, I am still having issues with the way I draft my emails. I am a designer, not a copywriter, which really doesn’t help!</p>

<p>I was wondering if you could tel me how you think this email works for you if you have 5 mins - mo worries if not.</p>

<p>Many thanks
Steve</p>

<p>Subject: Hi Matthew, I want to help you find new business leads at your worldwide exhibition events</p>

<p>Hello Matthew, I came across the SPI Lasers website while on LinkedIn today, and really like what the business does and noticed that SPI Lasers attend some exciting exhibitions around the world.</p>

<p>I own a growing design and marketing agency and thought it might be worth us having a meeting to see if we can help you out with your exhibition and promotional work?</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to meeting you in the next couple of weeks, so would it be ok to arrange a meeting with you today?</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Steve</p>

<p>Hey Steve, 
 
Thanks for buying the book! I don’t normally do full email breakdowns (you know how it is, once you do one 100 people ask) but since I have some free time…</p>

<p>Subject: Hi Matthew, I want to help you find new business leads at your worldwide exhibition events
 
This is a great title. However, it is a little long and getting lost in the inbox. I just sent it to myself in gmail and it barely fits in the title bar, with some of the most intriguing parts almost at the end. Have you ever heard the expression “don’t bury the lede”? I think that applies here. 
 
I’d think about shortening this down to:</p>

<p>Hi Matthew – a tip for you on finding more leads at the exhibitions you attend </p>

<p>I think this will give you better results because it’s intriguing the person to click on this email. I want to click on this email and see what the tip is you’re promising. It will at least warrant a click. From there, it’s your job to bring it home (which we have to do). 
 
 Hello Matthew, I came across the SPI Lasers website while on LinkedIn today, and really like what the business does and noticed that SPI Lasers attend some exciting exhibitions around the world.
 
This is good. It’s pretty standard, you might not have to add anything but I might shorten it a bit and add something personal that you can add quickly. For example:</p>

<p>Hello Matthew,</p>

<p>I came across the SPI Lasers website on linkedin this morning – and really like ! I also noticed that SPI Lasers attend some exciting exhibitions around the world. </p>

<p>Since you’re already inserting a custom first name and business name into this email you’ll probably find it not too hard to come up with something basic yet personal about each company you can use to really drive home the point that this is a hand-written email you took the time to craft. (More on automating this part to make it super quick below)</p>

<p>I own a growing design and marketing agency and thought it might be worth us having a meeting to see if we can help you out with your exhibition and promotional work?
 
I’m not sure I like how you’re asking for the meeting here. it comes off unconfident and unconvincing. Might be worth? if you’re not sure it’s worth it, why are you emailing? I also don’t care if your design agency is growing I care if my business is growing. </p>

<p>Instead I’d try a different approach (see below). </p>

<p>Next, you go on to ask for a meeting:</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to meeting you in the next couple of weeks, so would it be ok to arrange a meeting with you today?
 
Kind regards
 
Steve
 
I think you’re rushing the process here. A first email is a very fast way to expect a meeting.</p>

<p>Instead I’d change the ask completely. Right now you’re asking someone (who’s probably extremely busy btw) to not only make time to read this email and reply but you’re also asking them to open up their calendar,  take time out of their schedule, and commit to doing something with that time that may or may not give them any value at all…. THAT’S A TOUGH ASK. </p>

<p>Let’s dial it back. Instead i’d switch to a different ask all together. First, you haven’t established that this is the right person you’re talking to. A lot of people might have someone who specifically handles the exhibitions, and you’re barking up the wrong tree. </p>

<p>Also, you haven’t given them anything of value yet to warrant this person to try helping you or allow them to give you time on their calendar or even a reply. </p>

<p>Here’s what I’d try instead:</p>

<p>I know as you prepare for each exhibition it’s tempting to just rehash the same old exhibition and promotional materials – what MOST companies do – but I’ve found that my clients are actually shocked when they see how much more cost efficient it can be to personalize or tailor a new presentation to each venue (sometimes it’s even cheaper than re-using old stuff!).</p>

<p>And considering the amount of time and money you have to invest to attend these, a sharp increase in the amount of {desired result} by grabbing a couple low hanging fruits can make a lot of sense!</p>

<p>Are you the right person to discuss this with?</p>

<p>Steve
(Link to your email course: 5 ways to maximize your exhibition booths)</p>

<p>You can obviously tweak the part about tailoring a new presentation to whatever it is that YOU area actually offering, I just took a stab in the dark…</p>

<p>But here you’ve delivered value. You’ve opened their eyes and already have potentially made them a huge return or saved them money by alerting them to this fact. You’ve given away some of your best piece of advice in your email. </p>

<p>Since you’ve done this, a prospect is way more likely to respond. They’re now in your debt … and it takes away the scammy or salesy vibe from the email because you’ve just demonstrated that you have their best interest at heart. </p>

<p>You don’t have to use this exact script, you can definitely revise or make it your own but I think following these principles will make this email template way more profitable! It takes your email from good to great!</p>

<p>Oh and - this is important - if you haven’t done this yet, I’d also make sure I automate this sequence.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve used quickmail.io to create the followup sequence for you (there’s a button at the bottom you can use to copy this sequence directly into your account). I’ve even dropped in your (revised) cold email into this template.</p>

<p>Just following up with quickmail will automatically 5x your response rate if you’re currently not following up.</p>

<p>Welp! there’s my value bomb for the day. </p>

<p>Robert</p>

<p>BTW, i’m in the process of revising the book from scratch with a bunch more examples, and case studies i’ll be sure to send it your way once it’s ready.</p>

<p>Would you be interested in leaving a testimonial, it’s clear you’ve implemented the material great!
