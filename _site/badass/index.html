    <p>Adding something to your service – is easy. Adding something – that actually helps your customer is tough.</p>

<p>Worse, customers ask you to add things all of the time.</p>

<p>Being a one-person company, I’ve had to ignore most requests. The truth is I don’t want to improve the service. I want to improve the people who use the service. I want to make freelancers better at finding work.</p>

<p>So, a couple months ago I added a new feature. It was a subtle design decision that I implemented into the newsletter.</p>

<p>I added faces.</p>

<p>Now every lead I send includes a photo of the person looking to hire a freelancer.</p>

<p>The funny thing is no one has ever requested this feature. It’s even a bit of a pain to do, but I still think the results are worth it.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about conversion, churn, or revenue for Workshop.</p>

<p>I’m talking the important results. My customers results.</p>

<p>It’s sparked more engagement and better emails. How do I know? Because Workshop members get to see the person they’re emailing. It’s a fact. No stats needed (although click rates on the emails are up substantially).</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, one of the most common feature requests I get is quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Some customers cite that it takes them an extra 30 seconds to go through the leads because, although each email is filtered by category, it’s not limited to just one specialty. They want to only get one specific subset of leads (for example Wordpress).</p>

<p>They say that if I got rid of the leads that didn’t pertain to them, they would save those 30 seconds every morning.</p>

<p>I haven’t implemented this feature. Why? Because although it would make my product more awesome, it wouldn’t make my customers more awesome.</p>

<p>People in Workshop are already saving 99% of the time it takes to track down leads. If this saved time isn’t enough, an  extra 30 seconds won’t make a difference either.</p>

<p>When I ask this group how many leads they’re responding to they usually say zero. In other words, they wouldn’t get more out of the newsletter even if it took no time to read at all.</p>

<p>The goal of Workshop isn’t to make it effortless to find work. It’s to make my customers more awesome at finding work.</p>

<p>Adding a more customized selection of leads would technically make my product more awesome. But adding faces makes the emails my customers send more awesome. Which also makes my customers more awesome.</p>

<p>I’ll choose that feature everyday.</p>
