		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">How I Write Clearly</h1>
    <p><a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Clear writing</a> is one of the biggest business advantages I can think of. By just making things easy to understand you’ll win more clients, more friends, and create better work.</p>

<p>Still, confusing writing is very common. Organizing your thoughts and getting ideas across can be hard. Software never really helped, either. It usually just got in my way.</p>

<p>So I toughed it out for a while. I’d write in Draft or a text editor, but organizing always became a mess.</p>

<p>Then I came across an old article by Edward T. Thompson for the International Paper Company. This article, How to Write Clearly, helped me more than any software I’ve come across. It’s how I wrote my new book <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Emails That Win You Clients</a> (now available for pre-order).</p>

<p><a href="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/downloads/writing-clearly.pdf"><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/clear-writing.png" alt="How To Write Clearly" /></a></p>

<p>The basis of the technique is this: you write each point you want to make on an index card. This creates piles of index cards you can then set out and organize.</p>

<p>It allowed me to group my writing into chapters and sections. Each card had a point I wanted to make, each stack of cards was a chapter.</p>

<p><img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/etw-index-cards.png" alt="Emails That Win index on my floor" /></p>

<p>The end result is an extremely clear and focused book. It made it easy to make sure all the points I made built on each other. It all happens right in front of you in real-time so you can really focus on the order you want to say things.</p>

<p>That makes your writing very logical and easy to read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. – Jason Fried</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d recommend you read the article and practice the technique if you are a designer, marketer, or developer. It can really help with writing books, blog posts, emails, sales copy and virtually every type of marketing you can think of.</p>

<p>When I showed it to a few of my friends in a mastermind chat, they started using it for picking features in app development and even planning and building client websites.</p>
