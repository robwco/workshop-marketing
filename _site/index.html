<h1 id="the-right-clients-coming-to-you-everyday">The right clients coming to you everyday</h1>

<p>Stop waiting for your next client &amp; get qualified leads delivered right to your inbox each morning instead. We search the internet for the best consulting projects in your specialty, and deliver just the right leads to your inbox everyday. <a href="#signup">Starting at only $229 for 90 days</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="if-i-could-just-get-more-clients-on-the-phone-i-would-sell-more-projects">“If I could just get more clients on the phone, I would sell more projects.”</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the first thing I hear when I ask consultancies about dry spells. And they’re right. You land work more often often when you’re in front of the right clients.</p>

<p>But it’s a time suck to separate the right opportunities from the wrong ones. It takes sifting through old emails, job postings, tweets, forums, and more. It takes so long that nearly every freelancer avoids it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Running an independent design consultancy, one of the hardest things I do on a daily basis is get sales. Robert helped me do things in a more focused, actionable way to get the business that my clients &amp; I both deserve. Because I never learned how to write good email in design school, &amp; neither did you.” <br /><cite>– Nick Disabato, Owner of <a href="http://draft.nu">Draft <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> in Chicago IL.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-if-you-had-a-steady-stream-of-the-right-clients-coming-to-you-everyday">What if you had a steady stream of the right clients coming to you everyday?</h2>

<p>You’d no longer have to constantly rebuild your pipeline from scratch. You wouldn’t have to be that guy that constantly bugs his network for work. You’d simply wake up to an inbox full of leads looking to hire a freelancer like you.</p>

<p>Better yet, just knowing clients are coming would mean no longer stressing out about dry spells and the feast or famine cycle. It would be simple to store away a waiting list of clients to follow up with anytime you need work.</p>

<p>But that’s not all it would do for you. Having clients coming to you would mean you have more time. More time to over-deliver on client projects. Or if you’re like me, more time to spend with your family. If you always had access to the best opportunities, you’d simply land more work.</p>

<h2 id="let-workshop-send-you-a-recurring-stream-of-potential-client-revenue-everyday">Let Workshop send you a recurring stream of potential client revenue everyday.</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Effortlessly keep tabs on over 300 job boards, forums, and industry sites.</strong> What’s the best job board? All of them. Let me sort through every project on every job board and send you the ones that are high-quality, remote, and relevant to your skill set, so you don’t have to lift a finger. More sites added daily.</li>
</ul>

<!--- **Create a custom client shortlist that's always waiting for you.** Access Workshop's back-catalog of thousands of  past leads and save any one to follow up with whenever you need work. Creating a lead shortlist is easy and you can even download it as a CSV or use your favorite CRM. -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get additional background information for each lead.</strong> This 10+ hour a week time saver means we find additional info for every lead like name, email, website and a photo of the client – so you can know exactly who to email and what to say.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fill your pipeline with 200+ new opportunities every month for only $179/month.</strong>  You get to focus all of your time and energy exclusively on winning new projects and building your pipeline from day one of signing up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-its-right-for-me">How do I know if it’s right for me?</h2>

<p><strong>I’m not at the level I want to be at yet. What if I’m not ready?</strong></p>

<p>Workshop is particularly great for design and development work. If you can produce design or code - at any level - you can make a lot of money from the leads I send.</p>

<p>Leveling up your consulting business isn’t about planning for the future. It’s about taking small steps right now that will ensure you’re in the best position to succeed when the time comes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="ive-gotten-over-my-imposter-syndrome">“I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome</h2>
  <p>I like to focus on projects that are particularly interesting to me, and fit my skill set well so I was reluctant to sign up at first.</p>

  <p>But amongst the work I scored from Workshop last year were two projects that have now blossomed into amazing client relationships and tens of thousands of dollars… with no end in sight. I was really on the fence about Workshop (and freelancing in general), but I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome at this point and realize I can compete and score some of these great leads.</p>

  <p>I can honestly say that being a customer of yours for the past year-ish has made me a much smarter (and better) freelancer. I’m crushing it – well into 6 figures in revenues this year, and exceeding my “projections” by like 50% (absurd!). I haven’t been doing this that long, but I’m very confident in my abilities as a businessman, client relationship manager (and of course, designer).

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Will I be locked in for a long time?</strong></p>

<p>No. To start you only need to commit to 3 months. After that Workshop is pay as you go. You can cancel at any time and there’s no contract or long-term commitment. There’s zero risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="at-first-i-was-worried-about-the-lead-quality-and-quantity">“At first I was worried about the lead quality and quantity.</h2>

  <p>If the leads weren’t a good match for my services or there wasn’t enough of them then the service wouldn’t have worked for me. Once I figured out my process it made it easy to compliment my own lead generation process.</p>

  <p>Every day there was a good chance that at least one lead in Workshop could use my services.
The best thing about Workshop is it runs on email so it’s easy to process, archive, or save. If I get busy I can leave it alone until I have time for it. Leads grouped by type let me ignore the ones that don’t apply to me.</p>

  <p>The additional contact information makes it easier to find the actual people behind the project. The educational content around writing better emails and other topics help me improve my own process.
It’s a great service to supplement other forms of marketing because it requires very little time.
It’s especially valuable if someone is checking job boards by hand because there are a lot of full-time and non-remote leads that you’d have to filter out.</p>

  <p>In less than a year I’ve won close to $65,000 in projects from Workshop alone. All of them have become repeat clients who I expect would be buying additional services over the next few years.

<p><strong>My shop is outside of the US, is that a problem?</strong></p>

<p>Nope. Workshop works with consultancies from all over the world. All leads are 100% remote and open to remote shops anywhere, so you don’t have to be in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="being-from-outside-the-us-i-was-intimidated">“Being from outside the US, I was intimidated</h2>
  <p>I ordered Workshop because it sounded like a dream way to receive possible leads. I hesitated for a while but ordered after a week. Robert wrote in one of his first emails, that it takes time and practice to actually land a project, and that it can take weeks or even months.</p>

  <p>I had no problem with that. Nevertheless, I landed my first project after just 4 or 5 days. The monthly cost of Workshop is covered already, and I still have weeks left from my first month. I’ll keep being a Workshopper, thanks Robert!

<ol>
	<li><p><strong>You don’t have a process for emailing these leads.</strong> Workshop isn’t magic. It’s not going to make client work rain from the heavens. You can’t sit and wait. You'll need to do the work. We'll find great clients for you but you will still need to put in the effort it takes to win them. Shops who succeed in Workshop (and make 10s of thousands of dollars) don’t disqualify themselves by not doing the work. If you do, we can't help.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>You think I’ll be sending you your ideal clients.</strong> The truth is you are never going to receive a lead that checks off every thing you want to see in a client. Why? Because ideal clients aren't found, they're created by working with them and educating them. I’ll send you great people who need a problem solved. It’s your job to turn them into ideal clients.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>You’re currently booked 8–12+ months in advance.</strong> That’s a solid, healthy pipeline. That’s the type of pipeline Workshop will help you get. But if you’re already there you probably don’t need Workshop at the moment. Once your waiting list gets down to 3–4 months, it’s a great time to hire Workshop.</p></li>

<h2 id="why-you-should-join-right-now">Why you should join right now</h2>
<p>Since starting Workshop 2 years ago, I’ve seen several copycat services come and go. These look-a-like services use automated scraping tools to find leads. I don’t believe in that. Only a real, experienced, freelancer knows what a great client looks like. Not some crappy script.</p>

<p>That’s why while the other services continue to disappear, Workshop’s value will continue to increase. Today Workshop provides 5x more value to subscribers than when we started (and costs more than 5x our initial price — and as we add new features, the price will only increase).</p>

<p>Lastly, it’s a common misconception that dry spells are a part of consulting. The truth is they happen because you sit and wait. Failing to line up work during flush times (not just during dry spells), is the real reason you run into feast or famine cycles. Just because you have work now, you’re short on time, or you have some other excuse, you shouldn’t put your hands up and stop all sales activity.</p>

<p>See like you, I’ve been through dry spells. And I know there are a ton of businesses out there who will benefit from working with me. That’s why I’ve put myself in front of you right now, and I believe it’s your turn to put yourself in the same position to find businesses you can help.</p>
