<h2 id="how-to-get-a-steady-stream-of-clients-coming-to-you">How to get a steady stream of clients coming to you</h2>

<p>Getting fired hit me like a ton of bricks. I still remember the copy machine going off in the background moments after my boss told me he was letting me go. That buzzing sound still rings in my ears years later because it was truly a wake-up call.</p>

<p>I realized that as a full-time employee I had no control – and although a lot has changed since – one thing hasn’t. My desire to have more of this control. This site is about helping you get control of your freelancing business. But I’ll tell you right now, it’s going to require action.</p>

<p>See despite the fire in my belly, I soon became dependent again. This time it wasn’t to a boss or coworker. It was to my sales pipeline. Suddenly, I needed clients. Feeding my family depended on it and the stress was getting to me.</p>

<h2 id="but-im-too-busy-to-look-for-work">“But I’m too busy to look for work.”</h2>

<p>One day, years later, I found myself without any clients. I’d gone through dry spells before but this one was bad. Each day the stress mounted. The importance of every new potential client meeting ballooned greater than the last. I went into every meeting thinking one thing: “I need this job.”</p>

<p>I was desperate, and clients could smell my desperation a mile away. It took me weeks to find my next client. It was a horrible feeling.</p>

<p>But something good came out of it. A desire to understand dry spells. A desire that led me to conducting a survey. I asked over 500+ freelancers two questions: “what do you do when you run out of work?” and “how much do you make?” The results were a big surprise:</p>

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3">
			<p class="uppercase" style="margin:0 0 1em; text-align:center; font-size: 18px;">The results from my freelancer survey about dry spells:</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="big-stat-number">40%</td> 
		<td class="big-stat-number">24%</td>
		<td class="big-stat-number">12%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stat-caption">Use social media</td>
		<td class="stat-caption">Wait for clients</td>
		<td class="stat-caption">Email prospects</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The activities that freelancers thought would get them work weren’t the shocking part. The shocking part was seeing how each of these correlated to income. In fact, one group made way more than the others.</p>

<p><strong>It was the freelancers who emailed prospects that made 2.5x more money than those who did nothing.</strong></p>

<p>It was so obvious and yet almost everyone (close to 90%) overlooked it. For me, it meant I had the power to change my fortune. So I started to experiment. I cold emailed one new client every day for weeks and soon my income tripled.</p>

<h2 id="i-feel-like-ive-put-all-of-my-eggs-in-one-basket">“I feel like I’ve put all of my eggs in one basket.”</h2>

<p>Eventually I got busy with client work again and stopped emailing clients. I told myself it was okay because I’d “pick things back up if they calmed down”. But the truth was, in the back of my head I knew I was making the same mistake.</p>

<p>I was relying too much on the work I had. I knew that at any second my current batch of clients could pull the rug from underneath me. And the worst part was despite realizing this - and even expecting it - I wasn’t doing anything to prepare.</p>

<p>Projects seemed to end in bunches. One second I was juggling projects and the next I was scrambling to find a single client. By the time things “calmed down” it would be too late. Something needed to change.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re saying. This sounds exactly like what you’re going through. I know because this cycle is an epidemic amongst freelancers. We’re so busy doing great work for our clients that we “forget” to maintain a healthy pipeline for ourselves.</p>

<p>There’s even a term for it: the feast or famine cycle. It keeps thousands of freelancers up at night - and afraid to look at their bank account at any particular moment. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-time-to-find-leads-by-hand">“I don’t have time to find leads by hand.”</h2>

<p>I felt like I was on to something with emailing leads but it was just too time intensive to do myself. As a high-paid freelancer, I was looking at over $2,000+ lost in billable hours each month!</p>

<p>Losing that much time wasn’t sustainable for me, as I doubt it is for you. Finding leads is hard - especially when you’re up to your nose in client work. Spending half your day on job boards looking for good projects is a bad use of time for a freelancer.</p>

<p>So that’s when I started experimenting with different options. First I “hired” my girlfriend (now wife, Hi Kieranne!) to do it for me. That lasted about a minute.</p>

<p>Next, I considered a sales person. But after asking around I realized how expensive that would be… about 50% of my total sales. (So if I landed a $10,000 contract, they might ask for $5,000!). It was just too much.</p>

<p>I ended up paying a VA over $600 one month to look for leads. But it didn’t produce a single quality lead for me, plus I was wasting almost as much time training them as I would just finding leads myself.</p>

<p>I wished another option existed. I wanted to hire someone like myself to do this for me. Then I had an idea. If I wanted this maybe other freelancers did too? That’s how I created this page you’re reading now, with a simple offer: I’ll find great projects daily and email them to you.</p>

<h2 id="i-just-want-a-steady-stream-of-clients-coming-to-me">“I just want a steady stream of clients coming to me.”</h2>

<p>The service took off. It’s a testament to how effective it is that I’ve now sent over 10,000 high-value freelance projects, and helped freelancers find over $1 million USD in client work.</p>

<p>It took me a while to nail down the process but the results have been phenomenal. I find over 250 great freelance leads every single week – consistently more than I know what to do with.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve refined my process so much that I’d like to share it with you now - for free, no strings attached - so even if you don’t end up buying this service from me you can still have the same success. Ready?</p>

<h2 id="heres-what-you-get">Here’s what you get:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>First, I monitor <strong>every job board on the web for project-based design and development opportunities</strong>. Note: <a href="http://app.letsworkshop.com/monitoring">there’s well over <strong>300 job boards, news, and industry websites</strong></a> included in this daily search.</li>
  <li>Next, I do <strong>additional custom searches</strong> on sites like <strong>Google, Twitter, Linkedin</strong> and more to find recent opportunities that may have slipped through the cracks. (This includes <strong>RFP’s, tenders, and other projects</strong> that aren’t listed on job site.)</li>
  <li>Then, I go through <strong>Workshop’s inbound lead pipeline</strong> - clients who’ve come exclusively to Workshop to look for a freelancer.  There’s been over 200 of these clients who have sent me their project directly. <strong>Only Workshop customers get these leads so the competition is low, and have a high average budget (around $10k-20k).</strong> These are some of the most valuable leads I find.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I <strong>qualify and sort this list of leads</strong> removing anything that isn’t <strong>freelance, project-based, remote or high-quality</strong>. I also find contact information like <strong>a name, email, and photo</strong> and sort them based on category so you waste no time when you get the email.</li>
  <li>As a bonus, you also get free copies of my book on <strong>writing client-winning emails, <a href="http://emailsthatwin.com">Emails That Win</a>, for you and up to 7 members of your team.</strong> <span class="price-callout">These are normally $79 each</span></li>
  <li>Additionally, an optional premium service you can get on top of all of this is <strong>done-for-you outreach</strong>. This is where I email every lead for you, get more information, and <strong>connect you directly with this now warm prospect</strong>. It’s a truly hands-free way to keep a warm pipeline, and a white-glove service I provide for <span class="price-callout">$199/month</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-pipeline-is-burning-bright-even-when-im-swamped">“My pipeline is burning bright even when I’m swamped”</h2>

<p>This process has resulted in over $1 million dollars of paid client work for freelancers all over the world since 2013. The crazy part is anyone could do it themselves in just 40-60 hours a month. (Even after refining this process, it still takes me about 4 hours every day.)</p>

<p>But the reason my customers see such a great ROI is that they don’t have to do it themselves. They don’t have to rely on will-power. They get to really multiply their efforts and skip years of building up a system for themselves.</p>

<p>So take a second to imagine what a consistent stream of clients would mean for your business. Imagine if you were no longer scared to check your bank account balance. If you had access to thousands of gigs you would’ve never seen before. If you were able to find new clients in just minutes a day. And if you could focus more time on what you love to do, knowing you have a system working while you sleep.</p>

<p>What would you do with that time? Where would you re-invest it? Who would you love spending more time with? That’s why you should sign up today.</p>

<p>And before you do I believe it’s important for me to prove everything I claim. I’m going to do that by showing you the progress my customers have made since joining. Their success is due 100% to the actions they’ve taken, not anything I’ve done. I’ve just helped them save time and remove barriers. And I’d love to do the same for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In less than a year I’ve won close to $65,000 in projects from Workshop alone. All of them have become repeat clients who I expect would be buying additional services over the next few years.</p>

  <p>The best thing is it runs on email so it’s easy to process, archive, or save. If I get busy I can leave it alone until I have time for it.</p>

<h2 id="sign-up-right-now">Sign up right now</h2>
<p>You only need to land one client for this to pay for itself for years. Give it six-months and if you’re not 100% happy I’ll give you a full refund.</p>

<p>But it’s critical you sign up today. See, it’s a common misconception that dry spells are just a part of freelancing. They’re not. The truth is they happen because you sit and wait. Failing to line up work during flush times (not just during dry spells), is the real reason you run into feast or famine cycles.</p>

<p>So just because you have work now, you’re short on time, or you have some other excuse, you shouldn’t put your hands up and stop all sales activity. It’s time to take action and Workshop will help you do that. Sign up below. Cheers!</p>
