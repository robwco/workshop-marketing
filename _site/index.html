        <h1 id="what-if-you-were-already-booked-through-november">What if you were already booked through November?</h1>

<p>As a tiny company, constantly finding new work to pitch and win can start to weigh you down. Month after month the same questions loom in the back of your mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Where will my next freelance project come from?”</li>
  <li>“Am I going to fall into a dry spell again?”</li>
  <li>“What if I run out of money before I find my next client?”</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t make any sense. Why should it be so hard to find a client when there’s thousands of companies out there you can help?</p>

<p>After all, with such a vast pool of potential clients and your level of expertise, shouldn’t you have new work whenever you want?</p>

<p>Yes! The problem isn’t your copy, portfolio, or your service. It’s finding these opportunities.</p>

<p>It takes time you don’t have. You have existing clients to take care of, important emails to write, and urgent fires to put out.</p>

<p>Doing lead generation on top of all of this just sucks. You want to do the work you love, not search for it. Worse, it’s unprofitable. That’s why you put it off.</p>

<p>So instead you wait for work to come to you (read: do nothing). But putting off finding work only makes things worse. Much worse.</p>

<p>It makes you have no control over the work you take on… so instead of firing bad clients, you’re forced to put up with them forever.</p>

<p>As a result, you don’t get paid what you’re worth, you don’t know where your next project will come from and you’re constantly worried about dry spells.</p>

<p>It’s not worth it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-believe-internet-trolls-freelancing-doesnt-have-to-be-feast-or-famine-you-dont-have-to-rely-solely-on-referrals">Don’t believe internet trolls, freelancing doesn’t have to be feast or famine. You <em>don’t</em> have to rely solely on referrals.</h3>

<p>It’s time to do something about your unprofitability. Your business should have access to all of the best clients and opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>Likewise, great clients should have access to your services and expertise – regardless of whether you remembered to check a job board.</p>

<p>But how? You know you can’t be everywhere at once. You can’t even imagine finding all of these opportunities yourself, how are you going to also make time to contact them?</p>

<p>You can’t.</p>

<p>You just need them delivered to you. That way, you can focus on selling your company, the thing you <strong>know</strong> how to do – the thing you love to focus on.</p>

<h2 id="refreshing-your-inbox-and-waiting-isnt-the-only-thing-you-can-do-when-you-run-out-of-work">Refreshing your inbox and waiting isn’t the only thing you can do when you run out of work.</h2>

<p>What if you woke up every day with a dozen great clients looking for your help, what would it mean to the profitability of your business?</p>

<p>Would your revenue double? Would it turn your on-the-side freelancing into your full-time six-figure consultancy? If, overnight, you got the best opportunities automatically instead of sitting and waiting by your phone.</p>

<p>Or if you could simply reply to people and projects you were excited to work for, straight from your inbox?</p>

<p>And what if it took minutes (instead of hours) to fill your sales pipeline each morning and then you got to focus exclusively on billable work the rest of the day?</p>

<p>What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client’s project and blow them away? Would you use the free time to go on a walk and clear your head?</p>

<p>Or would you just spend more time with people you care about?</p>

<h2 id="let-me-send-you-the-8-12-best-leads-every-day-so-you-can-wake-up-focused-on-winning-work">Let me send you the 8-12 best leads every day so you can wake up focused on winning work.</h2>

<p>You might think this life is impossible. However, for hundreds of consultancies in Workshop it’s a reality.</p>

<p>I’ve created a hands-free lead generation service for consultancies looking to make more money building websites (and apps, and logos, and more).</p>

<p>From the day you sign up, you receive the highest quality leads on the web. Every opportunity from every nook and cranny on the web, pre-qualified and sorted into your inbox.</p>

<p>It’s also super affordable. Even if you’re just freelancing on the side, you can easily take advantage of my offer. It’s the cost of a cup of coffee a day.</p>

<p>But you won’t love the service because it’s cheap, you’ll love it because it works and you know it’s the best thing you can do for your business.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-happens-if-i-dont-like-it">“So what happens if I don’t like it?”</h3>
<p>No worries. There’s a 30-day 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p>Enjoy Workshop for a full month and if you don’t like it for any reason, send me an email and I’ll give you a refund. I don’t want your money if you’re not 100% blown away.</p>

<h3 id="my-schedule-is-fully-booked-should-i-still-sign-up">“My schedule is fully booked. Should I still sign up?”</h3>
<p>Yes, here’s why: it’s a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen because we fail to line up work during <strong>flush times</strong> (times when we’re loaded with work) NOT only during dry spells.</p>

<p>Just because you have work now it doesn’t give you the right to put your hands up and stop all sales activity. On the contrary. Now is when you should start a small daily amount of activity to ensure you never run out of work again.</p>

<p>If you’re not booked at least 4-6 months in advanced, it’s a sign you’re susceptible to a dry spell.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-leads-will-be-sent-and-how-often">“How many leads will be sent, and how often?”</h3>
<p>I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes more, sometimes less but the whole point of Workshop is that it saves you time.</p>

<p>To make sure Workshop does that, I send fewer, better leads. I never send a lead just to hit a quota.</p>

<p>In fact, Workshop’s value is equally about the leads I don’t send you.</p>

<p>The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely mean you can focus on <em>how you’re contacting leads</em> instead.</p>

<h3 id="who-gets-these-leads-how-many-people-am-i-competing-with">“Who gets these leads? How many people am I competing with?”</h3>

<p>This is a great question. If you’re wondering about this it means you believe there are opportunities for you in Workshop, and now you’re wondering if you have a shot. That’s a great sign!</p>

<p>You absolutely do! The number one mistake I see freelancers make when they sign up for Workshop is assuming the leads are getting inundated with replies.</p>

<p>I’ve actually heard business owners complain that their project only received 1 or no replies. These were 5-figure projects!</p>

<p>So make sure you reply. If you send a good email, you will hear back.</p>

<p>How do I know? Well the truth is that for every type of lead I send there’s truly only 4-5 real competitors (or less). That number sounds low because there’s over a hundred people subscribed to Workshop but all members specialize in different areas.</p>

<p>Based on the amount of clicks I see happening in each email, every lead type attracts maybe 5-10% of the list. That means about 20 people from Workshop are clicking on that one you have your eye on.</p>

<p>Out of those 20 people, half eliminate themselves because they don’t think they’re right for the project. Another 5 or 6 are just too busy that day to reply, and even a couple more completely forget. This doesn’t take into account (the overwhelmingly high majority of those remaining) who will send a half-assed email.</p>

<p>So if I were you and wondering this question, I’d certainly sign up and reply to the project in Workshop. Even if you’re skeptical landing just one project will pay for Workshop for the next 5 years. What’s the worst that can happen?</p>

<h3 id="i-just-started-freelancing-what-if-im-not-ready">“I just started freelancing. What if I’m not ready?”</h3>
<p>I guarantee that if you can build a website, design, or code - at any level - you can also make a lot of money from Workshop today.</p>

<p>But it takes investing in yourself now.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how much experience you have, the habits you build into your business now will stay with you for a long time (maybe forever).</p>

<p>That’s why it’s important that you push yourself outside of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>Leveling up your consulting business isn’t about planning for the future. It’s about taking small steps right now that will ensure you’re in the best position to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="but-will-workshop-work-for-me-i-specialize-in-x">“But will Workshop work for me? I specialize in X.”</h3>
<p>Right now Workshop is mostly focused on web design and development. However, we have a steady amount of other work coming in like mobile, marketing, graphic design, and more.</p>

<p>I group leads in categories so you’ll be able to quickly see if there’s enough value for you.</p>

<p>If you’re still worried there may not be enough of your type of lead, the best advice I can give is to try it. There’s a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee for this exact reason.</p>

<p>Sign up for yourself and see.</p>

<h3 id="im-outside-of-the-us-is-that-a-problem">“I’m outside of the US, is that a problem?”</h3>
<p>Not at all. Workshop has top freelancers from all over the world, including places like Europe, Asia, and basically every other continent in the world who are loving the service.</p>

<p>All leads are 100% remote and open to remote freelancers anywhere in the world, so I’d suggest you sign up and see if it’ll work for you.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-doing-this-does-it-work">“How long have you been doing this, does it work?”</h3>
<p>I started doing this with select consultancies in November, 2013.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve helped hundreds land work. Some have even made hundreds of thousands of dollars from my leads. Now, I focus on Workshop full-time, which wouldn’t be possible if it didn’t produce massive results.</p>

<h2 id="what-my-clients-say">What my clients say…</h2>

  <h3 id="ive-gotten-over-my-imposter-syndrome">“I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome”</h3>

  <p>I like to focus on projects that are particularly interesting to me, and fit my skill set well. Amongst the work I scored from Workshop last year were two projects that have now blossomed into amazing client relationships and tens of thousands of dollars… with no end in sight. I was really on the fence about Workshop (and freelancing in general), but I’ve gotten over my imposter-syndrome at this point and realize I can compete and score some of these great leads.</p>

  <p>The day I took Workshop for a test drive, here’s how it went down:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>8:30 am- signed up for Workshop</li>
    <li>9:21 am- sent first email to lead</li>
    <li>10:22 am- had phone interview with lead</li>
    <li>10:40 am- received W-9 and project contract</li>
    <li>If this sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. And it actually happened.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because of Workshop I’m starting to build an on-going relationship with a client, which is beyond worth the cost. I typically don’t do reviews, rate things, etc, but this has to be said: Workshop is an incredibly EFFECTIVE tool, and a must-have for freelancers. Thanks so much!”</p>

  <p>I  ordered Workshop because it sounded like a dream way to receive possible leads. I hesitated for a while but ordered after a week. Robert wrote in one of his first emails, that it takes time and practice to actually land a project, and that it can take weeks or even months.</p>

  <p>I had no problem with that. Nevertheless, I landed my first project after just 4 or 5 days. The monthly cost of Workshop is covered already, and I still have weeks left from my first month. I’ll keep being a Workshopper, thanks Robert!</p>

  <h3 id="its-possible-to-actually-wind-up-with-more-work-than-i-can-handle-through-workshop">“It’s possible to actually wind up with more work than I can handle through Workshop!”</h3>
  <p>In seven months, I’ve closed 3 deals that total a little over $20,000-directly from the leads in Workshop. All three of these projects have led to long-term clients that continue to come back to me, so the value of these contracts continues to grow.</p>

  <p>One of the clients wanted a front-end developer, and now I am helping him build a travel booking engine. It has been a small but on-going project worth about $2,000 every month. Another client runs a successful e-Learning web application. I wrapped up the work that was in the scope of the project a few weeks ago, and just the other day, the client contacted me to see if I was available to take on some more work.</p>

  <p><strong>The discussions on the Workshop Forum (The Shed) has proven incredibly valuable, and have done a lot to improve my response-rate when emailing leads, my technique for following up, as well as my business in general.</strong> Truth be told, I probably could have gotten even more work through Workshop, but when I am very busy, I am selective about which leads I contact. It’s possible to actually wind up with more work than I can handle through Workshop! :-)</p>

  <p>BTW, I just closed another lead from Workshop, a deal to subcontract for a design agency. Its really great what you’re doing!”</p>

  <p>I signed up about 2 months ago when I decided to move away from my full time job and transition into freelancing. I put together a simple portfolio and replied to 2-3 ads per day consistently. After a month of the free trial I had made over $3000 off of Workshop leads and also got offered a full-time contract ($100,000/year roughly).</p>

  <p>That’s a bigger return than I ever expected. It’s brought a ridiculous return and if I ever move to freelancing again, first thing I’ll do is sign up for Workshop again.</p>

  <p>I waited a while before signing up - because at $100, the price was a steep investment.</p>

  <p>But the price actually ended up forcing me to improve because I started thinking of myself as a company rather than just a freelancer. It pushed me to think about having an actual sales funnel, and all the assets that go along with it.</p>

  <p>I’ve also really enjoyed the tips and help Workshop provides to help me close leads. I’ve created my sales funnel and will combine it with the hugely valuable slack community!</p>

  <p>At first I was worried about the lead quality and quantity. If the leads weren’t a good match for my services or there wasn’t enough of them then the service wouldn’t have worked for me.</p>

  <p>Once I figured out my process it made it easy to compliment my own lead generation process. Every day there was a good chance that at least one lead in Workshop could use my services.</p>

  <p>The best thing about Workshop is it runs on email so it’s easy to process, archive, or save. If I get busy I can leave it alone until I have time for it. Leads grouped by type let me ignore the ones that don’t apply to me. The additional contact information makes it easier to find the actual people behind the project. The educational content around writing better emails and other topics help me improve my own process.</p>

  <p>It’s a great service to supplement other forms of marketing because it requires very little time.</p>

  <p>It’s especially valuable if someone is checking job boards by hand because there are a lot of full-time and non-remote leads that you’d have to filter out.</p>

  <p>In less than a year I’ve won close to $65,000 in projects from Workshop alone. All of them have become repeat clients who I expect would be buying additional services over the next few years.</p>

  <p>At first I was unsure about whether the ROI would be worth the monthly cost. But after joining I realized the “potential” ROI is enormous and worth the cost.</p>

  <p>I like that while I get leads covering various types of work, they are grouped by those types of work making it easier to find the leads for the type of work I focus on.</p>

  <p>I’ve also been about to practice emailing people, get out of my head and realize that I am just sending an email and the worse thing that can happen is that it will go unread.</p>

  <p>It’s opened my eyes to the amount of work that is actually available, and not just what was represented by recruiter. This  realization that networking events and referrals aren’t the only ways to get leads and work has been huge for my mindset.</p>

  <p>It is vital to teaching people that they can find work for themselves, especially those who have relied on others, like friends and recruiters, for so many years.</p>

    <p>Every chapter in this book is pulled from the best breakthroughs from strategy sessions with over 50+ freelancers who were struggling to hear back from clients. I know the book will work for you because every one of these freelancers began to see results as soon as they implemented the material. Leads began responding. They started winning clients.</p>

    <p>With a premium account you’ll also get access to a special form where you can request leads be found just for you. Need a rails client in the dental industry? As a premium members you’ll be able to request this type of lead and have my team looking that same day.</p>

    <p>If we find it, you’ll see it in the following email. It’s like having a team of assistants ready to find you work at a moments notice. You unlock the ability to be able to request exactly the type of lead you want.</p>

    <p>That kind of personalization would cost you thousands of dollars every month if you hired me individually.</p>

    <h3 id="access-to-low-competition-big-budget-projects-found-only-on-workshop-premium-only">Access to low competition, big-budget projects found only on Workshop (premium only)</h3>

    <p>These are big budget projects projects you won’t find anywhere else. People come straight to Workshop to post big budget projects because they know that they’re going to get a response from a handful of great freelancers.</p>

    <p>Because Workshop is private, you won’t be competing with the entire world - just a handful of peers. These leads are so valuable that you have virtually no competition on $20k+ projects that fall directly in your specialty.</p>

    <p>But Workshop doesn’t step in or take a cut, you own 100% of the relationship with your clients and 100% of the project fee.</p>

    <p>There’s nothing between you and the clients I send you, you email them directly from your inbox and your conversation stays private. Like all my leads, there’s no middleman referral fees, no app, and no confusing system to work around. Just profit.</p>

<h3 style="margin: .25em 0 .6em;">The two biggest reasons why you should join right away</h3>
<p>1) The membership fee is at it's absolute lowest. Since starting Workshop in late 2013, there's been a bunch of copycat services pop up. These look-a-like services use automated scraping tools to find leads.</p>
<p>I don't believe in that. Only a real, experienced, freelancer knows what a great client looks like. Not some crappy algorithm. That's why while the other services continue to come and go, Workshop's price will continue to increase. Today it provides more than 4x the value than when we started.</p>
<p>
And when you sign up now and you'll be locked in at the lowest price Workshop will ever be sold at, for as long as you're a member.</p>
<p>
2) Waiting to sign up is almost guaranteed to hurt your business forever. See, It's a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen when you're fully-booked because you sit and wait.</p>
<p>
Failing to line up work during flush times (not dry spells), is the real reason you run into feast or famine cycles.</p>
<p>Just because you have work now, you're short on time, or you have some other excuse, you shouldn't put your hands up and stop all sales activity.</p>
<p>
On the contrary, now is when you should find next month's client. Ideally, you should be booked 4-6 months in advanced. I don't want you to wait until it's too late, and in order to prove it I'm willing to take away all of the risk. You can get 100% of your money back if you don't like it, at any time.</p>
<p>
See like you, I know there are a ton of businesses who will benefit from working with me. That's why I'm offering this guarantee. I want to put myself in the best position to find them. You can too. </p>
<p>
Only you know the vision you had when you decided to strike out on your own and start your freelance consulting business. My goal is to help you reach that vision.</p>
<p>
Warm Regards,</p>
