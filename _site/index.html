  <h1 class="leading-tight font-medium text-3xl pt-2">Fill the gaps in your freelancing with just a few minutes of outreach everyday</h1>

  <p>Most design/dev firms know that if you just get more clients on the phone you sell more projects.</p>

  <p>But how do you find clients worthy of pitching?</p>

  <p>The fastest way is to find warm leads that are looking to hire someone like you in places like job boards, forums, hacker news, and angellist. They’re out there waiting to be discovered by you or someone else.</p>

  <p>But the problem is it’s a time suck to separate these opportunities all by yourself.</p>

  <p>It takes so long that you will avoid it. The fact is if you’re loaded with billable hours, you don’t have time to sort through these sorts of sites every day.</p>

  <p>So, you never hear about 90% of the opportunities out there. This leads to feast or famine, where once you’re finished with a project, you’re left scrambling to find work.</p>

  <p>That leads to wasted time – or worse, accepting work from bad clients (just so you can pay the bills).</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">But UX and frontend design firms, you don't have to live with feast or famine anymore...</h2>

  <p>Here’s the facts: it’s way more effective to strategically contact a few warm opportunities every week, instead of waiting until your schedule is empty to send out a flurry of cold emails.</p>

  <p>But as we said, it takes time and as a consultant, an hour of your time alone is worth close to $100. That means you’re looking at a loss of over $2,000+ billable time per month!</p>

  <p><strong>In a perfect world, great leads would come to you.</strong></p>

  <p>This would allow you to save time, and get right to the important part: pitching clients and landing contracts.</p>

  <p>But setting up something like this for yourself can get expense. If you paid someone $10/hour, and they spent 2 hours a day gathering leads, you’d be looking at $600/month.</p>

  <p>That’s too much money. Instead, for less than the price you pay for a cup of coffee, you can pay me, a professional consultant, to find all of your outbound project leads web each morning.</p>

  <p>Ask anyone who’s hired lead gen like this, and they’ll say it’s usually really expensive, like 30% of your total sales. So if you landed a $10,000 contract, they might ask for $3,000!</p>

  <p>I have something better: for a small monthly fee, you’ll get the best UX and frontend design leads sent to your inbox, every day.</p>

  <p>You don’t pay any commission at all!</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">Introducing: Workshop, a hands-free lead-gen service for UX design firms only $229 per quarter...</h2>

  <p>You generate a consistent flow of clients and revenue for your business - and skip spending your time looking for leads (or hiring someone expensive to do it).</p>

  <p>All you have to do is send a couple short personal emails every few days to have multiple sales conversations going on at all times. This will let you focus the rest of your time exclusively on billable tasks.</p>

  <p>But does it work?</p>

<p>“On the first day I used this, I contacted 3 prospective clients and got three emails back. One of those turned into a solid gig. It's totally worth it so far.</p>

<p class="mt-2">A big reason why is that I know they'll be 100% freelance-friendly frontend leads and I don't have to do any thinking about whether it makes sense for me to apply or not. Thanks for creating Workshop!”</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">So, where and how do you find leads?</h2>

  <p><a href="/where-to-find-clients" class="text-black">My process is outlined in detail here</a>. I even recommend trying it yourself for free for a few weeks so you know exactly what you will get.</p>

  <p>The gist of it is this: I’ll sort through thousands of job posts, industry websites, and communities to find you relevant opportunities.</p>

  <p>The truth is there’s a lot of crappy job posts out there, and it’s crazy to expect a busy UX design firm to keep up with it all!</p>

  <p>I will automatically comb through the following websites and more so you never miss a good project:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/page-elements/leads-sources.png" class="w-full" /></p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">Can I just find these leads myself, for free?</h2>

  <p>Yes, <a href="/where-to-find-clients" class="text-blue">you can</a>. But you haven’t, and you never will. Committing to finding a set of leads day-in and day-out is tough, and intuitively you know your time is too valuable for that.</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">What kind of results can I expect? Will this replace my sales funnel?</h2>

  <p>No, this isn’t a replacement for your entire pipeline. This is just a way to start conversations and meet  people outside of your network with active gigs. Workshop’s delivery of 10-30 monthly outbound leads work best with a healthy dose (5-10) inbound leads. It will add thousands of dollars to your bottom line.</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">What kind of leads will you send me?</h2>

  <p>Workshop is focused on contract UX and frontend design gigs. We find most of our leads on job boards (hidden amongst thousands of full-time gigs we remove).</p>

  <p>We verify that each lead includes an email address, a realistic project outline, and is open to remote contract-based work. Members say that the leads I send reply at a higher rate than outreach they’ve done in the past.</p>

  <p>But they also have an unfair advantage. Job boards and prospecting no longer suck up all their billable time, so they’re better at contacting leads because they no longer teeter-totter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs from Workshop’s emails. All have saved the most precious thing of all; time.</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">I’m outside of the US, is that a problem?</h2>

  <p>Not at all. If you have a solid grasp of the english language you can and will win work from these leads. Workshop has top freelancers from all over the world, including places like Europe, Asia, and basically every other continent in the world who are loving the service. All leads are 100% remote and open to remote freelancers anywhere in the world, so I’d suggest you sign up and see if it’ll work for you.</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">What type, how many, and how often (etc.) will the leads be sent?</h2>

  <p>I never send a lead just to send it. The exact number depends on how many great clients post on a project that day, but basically I’m going to send you a handful of great gigs daily, allowing you to do less and get better results. So it’s just as much about the leads I don’t send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important. The fact is you don’t need all that many leads to make a lot of money; you just need the right leads.</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight mt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium">Workshop emails are hand-crafted everyday.</h2>

  <p>There’s no algorithm. No scraping tools. Just me following <a href="/where-to-find-clients/" class="text-grey-darkest">my own process of generating high-quality outbound leads</a> that meet the following criteria:</p>

  <p>They MUST be freelance leads, not full-time work. They MUST be remote, and open to freelancer’s anywhere. They MUST be quality projects (nothing below $10,000). And there must be an email attached to the lead.</p>

  <p>If that sounds good to you, let’s get started.</p>

  <p>Here’s how to take advantage now:</p>
