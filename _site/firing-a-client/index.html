		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">How to fire a client</h1>
    <p>I was recently approached by the owner of a design agency that needed help with setting up a mailing list. She was admittedly a novice at everything email marketing.</p>

<p>She loved my email campaigns and asked if I would be up for helping her write emails to her mailing list - so wanting to see her agency succeed, I agreed. Not going to lie, I’m busy and this wasn’t going to be a huge money making deal, so I wanted to move fast. In fact, I basically provided some free consulting and wrote her first email for her.</p>

<p>At that point, she “revised” my email and deleted a lot of the strategy and psychology I had used, instead writing a lot of empty rhetoric I’ve outlined in the common agency email.</p>

<p>Thinking I had not done a good enough job of communicating with her, I detailed my reasoning for making the email marketing decisions i had made - and why they were better than what she had written. I explained that her email, while sounding better to her, used a lot of the most common pitfalls people new to email marketing use. I asked her for some feedback on why she chose to make the changes to my that she had made. I provided my feedback PDF for her to follow: http://wonderfulfeedback.com.</p>

<p>She responded by basically saying she made the changes because she thought it would be best to combine her email style with my email. At that point I knew she hadn’t followed my instructions and used the feedback PDF to provide her feedback, so I decided to end my involvement on the project. Here’s how I did it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey XXXX, as I’ve been able to dive deeper into your project I’m seeing I may not be the right copy strategist you need for the project at this time. From our back and forth in the past week and the feedback you provided today, it seems you have a solid grasp of what you need - and are just looking for a hired hand to execute, which is totally fine - but to be honest, for that you can find someone a lot cheaper than me.</p>

  <p>I totally understand your position, but am noticing a trend of miscommunication to my requests (for example: the feedback you sent over today didn’t seem to follow the guidelines I provided) which worries me because I like to provide the best possible outcome as quickly as possible for my clients.
As I’m sure you know, some push-back is expected when working with new clients in order to get acclimated to working together, but from my point of view I think it would hurt the voice/style you want AGENCY_NAME to communicate in if I were to stay on in the project because we wouldn’t be able to work quickly enough.</p>

  <p>I can definitely help you find someone else who may be more suited to what you’re looking for. If interested, I can send over a couple names?”</p>
</blockquote>

	<p>Does it feel like clients expect near-instant gratification at all times? That type of client relationship kills your productivity and work-life balance... leaving you feeling burnt out.</p>
