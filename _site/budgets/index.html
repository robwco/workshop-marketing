		<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">Why some consultants 3X a clients budget, while others get low-balled</h1>
    <p>Hey, 
On Friday, I got an email from a Workshop member containing this beautiful nugget in the PS:</p>

<p><img src="/images/badass.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<p>This was reassuring in two ways:</p>

<p>I’m not the only one who awkwardly closes a parenthesis with a smiley face and then just DGAF.
Workshop, when used correctly, provides ridiculous amounts of ROI in my clients pockets.
So I replied and soon we got to talking about how this freelancer has been able to get such great results in such a short time. I’d like to share with you what he shared.</p>

<p>His consultancy does all the basics right (they don’t respond too many leads, they keep emails short, etc.), but one thing he mentioned, jumped out at me above all else:</p>

<p>“We’ve taken the mentality that most of these potential clients don’t know how much to charge for the work, so they don’t really put a price that matches. One client, we’re billing 3x more than they thought it would cost.”</p>

<p>Talk about a big win.</p>

<p>Often times a freelancer will scoff at a client’s proposed budget, and say “this guys trying to rip me off.”</p>

<p>I know because freelancers email me with the same complaint, EVEN about Workshop leads (and I know these are good leads because I personally comb through them).</p>

<p>All it takes is a slight difference in approach to yield huge results and (as the savvy consultant mentioned) 3x more revenue.</p>

<p>This is advice I give to Workshop members all the time. The reality is most people (especially clients) simply aren’t technically trained in web design and development. They just do not know how much their project’s intricacies should cost so they give their best (read: low-ball) estimate.</p>

<p>Heck, I’m sure you wouldn’t know exactly how much a project should cost at first glance.</p>

<p>But, as a professional consultant, you’d probably be able to get a lot closer, and that’s why it’s your job to educate them about realistic pricing.</p>

<p>(Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t 100% of people with low budgets, there’s always a cheapskate in the bunch, but 95% of people aren’t simply trying to rip you off.)</p>

<p>It’s hard at first, even counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Because of how subjective creative work is, you might think telling a client their budget is unrealistic is guaranteed to make you sound sleezy.</p>

<p>But it’s often the opposite result.</p>

<p>If you say, “look I know I may not make a single cent on the project because of this, but I think you need to spend 2 times your budget,” it won’t make you sound sleezy, it will make you sound like you have the client’s best interest at heart (aka: you’re not afraid to say the truth, even if it means losing the project)</p>

<p>That’s valuable.</p>

<p>And let’s get one thing straight: people love to be sold to, if they’re receiving value.</p>

<p>Being sold something awesome is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Telling someone their budget is unrealistic forces you to justify that claim, and can make you talk in terms of value.</p>

<p>For example, is 32GB worth $300? Hell no. What if those 32GB carried your entire music collection in your pocket and came with an interface engineered for maximum funness? Why that’s a steal!</p>

<p>I’m assuming you loved every bit of buying an ipod – even though you could’ve gotten a cheaper mp3 player – because you knew it would be worth it.</p>

<p>How Apple spoke to you, the words they used, the commercials they ran, made you know they were on your side. You could just feel that they understood your music listening needs.</p>

<p>So let’s take one of your clients as an example. </p>

<p>If you alert a client that what they’re looking for should actually cost 2 or 3 times what think – and you soundly explain why – you’ve simultaneously established a deep expertise AND shown the client you have their best interest at heart.</p>

<p>Make it clear you are willing to stick to this claim, even if it means losing out on their project and not making a cent, because you think it’s in their best interest.</p>

<p>A client hires you because you know more about your area of expertise then they do. Much like you’ve subscribed to this list because you’re looking for ways to improve your business.</p>

<p>So here’s the value pitch I want to make you, as one of my clients. If you’re reading this for pure intellectual stimulation and don’t intend on using any of it to help better your client’s, close the window now. The reason is simple: you can find a funnier and smarter email newsletter to subscribe to.</p>

<p>However, if you’re looking to truly change your business, I feel it would be a disservice to your business to unsubscribe.</p>

<p>In fact, I think you should invest MORE. The key is you have to implement the advice.</p>

<p>More on that tomorrow. </p>

<p>– Robert</p>
