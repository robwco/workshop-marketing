    <p>Creating upsell opportunities through outstanding on boarding
⁃	What do most freelancers and agencies do when a client pays?
⁃	They do the work and then forget about them
⁃	They don’t follow up
⁃	They don’t check in
⁃	They’re off looking for more work
⁃	They’ve done the hard part: landed a great client
⁃	And yet they just walk away like it’s nothing
⁃	Instead what I want you to do is automate a great experience for them. 
⁃	Have every single client pay through the same form.
⁃	There’s a bunch of different ones but I recommend Hiveage, it’s the way my contractors pay me. 
⁃	Connect this payment form to a drip campaign that will follow up with them indefinitely every three months. 
⁃	Send the 10k email
⁃	
⁃	Send checkins and follow ups</p>

  <p>Rob, Howdy! How’re things going with Workshop? Been a while since we chatted, figured I’d reach out. Take care, nickd! http://nickd.org https://draft.nuPushing current and existing clients to this contact form when they need more work</p>

<p>This will be one of your highest performing campaigns you’ve ever created and yet it’s dead simple</p>

<p>•	The email course drip campaign that will sell clients with long sales cycles
⁃	A lot of freelancers complain about long sales cycles this is when it takes a client months or sometimes years to decide on a project.
⁃	That’s because they do it wrong
⁃	Let me introduce email courses 
⁃	Few freelancers use them, yet they’re a great tool for delivering value
⁃	A client signs up to one
⁃	Automatically they’re sent articles you’ve written that deliver them value
⁃	As they receive these articles, they trust you
⁃	You are now the authority on these topics in their mind
⁃	Suddenly no one can compete with you
⁃	You’re able to sell every aspect of your expertise
⁃	All of the knowledge you’ve accumulated
⁃	All of the value you have in your head can now be transferred and presented to the client
⁃	All those rushed emails, sales calls, and more that you thought you didn’t really get a chance to say how you would help perfectly
⁃	Now you can with email courses
⁃	A client gets to build trust with you
⁃	So that when it’s time to buy there’s no hard sell
⁃	It’s just a client that KNOWS they’re getting a return on their investment
⁃	This how you create ideal clients</p>

<p>•	How to write an email course focused on delivering value and selling your services
⁃	HOW</p>

<p>•	How to get clients signed up to your email course</p>

<p>•	How to get traffic funneled to your email course and contact form
⁃	Use your blog
⁃	Use your email signature</p>

<p>•	How to automate a upsells into your client on boarding</p>
