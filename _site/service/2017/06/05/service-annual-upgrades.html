		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Annual upgrades</h1>
    <p>This is an email I used to create a huge spike in revenue. I want to use it in the future to create an evergreen annual upgrade email. Think about how you can use something like this with your clients to create a hard-to-resist offer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scott</p>

  <p>I hope you’re doing well. I’m emailing you because there’s a couple urgent matters I gotta touch base with you on. not everyone is getting this email.</p>

  <p>First off did you know you’re about to lose out on $689?</p>

  <p>The current pricing for Workshop is $99/month and it’s about to go up in price again as I release some big improvements and additional features to Workshop.</p>

  <p>Right now you can upgrade to yearly billing for $499 but I won’t be offering this price once the new features kick in. That means you can lock-in your Workshop subscription at this $41/month introductory price forever right now. </p>

  <p>I don’t normally send an email like this if you’re on monthly billing but because of the coming improvements to Workshop i need to let you know what you’ll be missing out on so you can make a truly informed decision about whether you should commit to Workshop for a year.</p>

  <p>That’s also why what’s coming is so exciting to me it’s all designed to land you more work and end dry spells - and it’s about to be released very soon (in June/July)- you’ll be able to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Turn off categories that you’re not interested in so you don’t waste even a second.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Track your progress by making sure you’re hitting milestones like emailing leads, getting replies, and winning clients.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Have your own personal email specialist (Julie) find leads that match your specialty, and help you land them by writing emails for you and keeping you accountable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use Workshop to land referral work by sending leads to your friends in one-click.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Automated follow up reminders when you have a warm lead to make sure you never forget to follow up.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Access to twice as many premium leads now that I run Folyo.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>All of this stuff will be released in the next 2 weeks and all of this is going to make it easier for you to find work.</p>

  <p>Like i said already the new features will also come with an increase in price and a cap on the amount of members we take in. </p>

  <p>That’s why this is sorta urgent.</p>

  <p><a href="#">If you’d like to upgrade to yearly billing and save $689 on your subscription each year and lock-in this rate forever, use this link to upgrade now.</a></p>

  <p>If you have any questions you can just hit “reply” or call me personally at 760-693-3360.</p>

  <p>Looking forward to having you as a customer!</p>

  <p>Regards,
Robert</p>
