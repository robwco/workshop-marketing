<p>How to automate multi-step client sales interactions that feels like a personal 
by setting up a system once that keeps working for you</p>

<p>high-touch</p>

<p>Have you ever sold something and had to repeat yourself over and over? Over the past year I’ve sold Workshop to a bunch of different people (over 500 actually) and the process gets repetitive quickly. Without automation, selling to this many people wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p>Some examples of automation include: <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">Workshop’s long form sales page</a> which does a great job of anticipating and answering most questions. It also lets you sign up for a free course that drips more information into your inbox. Plus, I have a <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/advice">new FAQ</a> that answers Workshop + other related questions.</p>

<p>But still some people prefer to talk to a real person. They rather open up their email and fire over a quick question. I get that. Instead of trying to stop these tire-kickers, I decided to use a years worth of knowledge to answer their questions in a way that felt like I was writing to them but was 100% automated.</p>

<p>In practice this meant someone could send me their question, and get an automated answer back from me. Sort of like a create your own adventure book. I was able to do this with <a href="http://mbsy.co/drip/10089555">automation feature in Drip</a>, using ideas from Patrick McKenzie’s recent email: <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/sales_automation">Systematizing Sales With Software And Processes</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing this system has been one of the biggest wins for me (and my inbox) this year. Here’s what the process looks like:</p>

<p><strong>When people sign up for a free sample of leads, they also get a follow up email:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-welcome.png" alt="Workshop's Course Welcome Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve used this email before (without the links at the end) and it always got a high reply rate. But now even people who don’t have time to reply DO have time to click on one of those options. This is also where a years-worth of (at times brain-numbing) customer service paid off.  I came up with these 4 options because I knew it always came down to those 4. Note: I don’t keep track of the responses or do anything with the feedback, it simply triggers a follow-up email.</p>

<p><strong>Clicking on one of the options triggers a one-off email that addresses their feedback:</strong></p>

<p><em>Subject: RE: how was the demo?</em>
<img src="http://knowingwhattosay.com/assets/images/workshop-course-followup.png" alt="Workshop's Course Follow-up Email" /></p>

<p>I’ve gotten a huge response rate to this email, because it feels so real – mostly because IT IS REAL. It’s exactly what I would say to one of those objections. It’s me.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-automate-your-outreach">How to automate your outreach</h2>

<p>So in the last example we discovered why following up is more important than almost anything else in the sales process. Next, we’re going to talk about automating it.</p>

<p>Let’s create a new example. Let’s say John Hustle follows up with most of his clients by hand. How ever Smart Sam uses an online tool to follow up.</p>

<p>Smart Sam’s tool doesn’t just remember to follow-up once, it remember to follow up 5 different times until the lead replies. If the lead does reply, Sam get a notification so that he never let’s a lead go cold.</p>

<p>Johnny Hustle doesn’t use the app. So when he’s bogged down by client work, or gets busy with other stuff he occasionally slips. It’s simply too hard for the human mind to keep track of 30 different conversations in different stages all while running a consultancy on top of that.</p>

<p>BUT wait, that’s not even the most important part of it all. Because Sam uses this tool to follow up, not only does she make sure she’s following up with every single lead a MINIMUM of 5 times – she spends less than half as much time on the process.</p>

<p>That means that despite Johnny Hustle dedicating hours each week to following up to potential projects by hand, he’s only covering a fraction of the amount of leads that Sam follows up with.</p>

<p>Essentially he’s playing on a completely different ball game. Sam is able to dedicated the extra half of her time to finding even more leads to put into her sales funnel.</p>

<p>That’s a game changer for her. She’s found that she needs to email 30 leads each month to find one client. Because she makes sure to follow up with each lead 4X minimum, that means that a higher percentage of those leads become clients.</p>

<p>However, the kicker is that because she’s able to spend more time finding leads, she can also find 2x as many leads to email. That means she’s able to generate more than twice as many clients each month.</p>

<p>This allows her to either choose her favorite client and only work with her SUPER IDEAL clients or take on both clients and sub-contract out the work she can’t handle to her team… essentially creating passive income for her business.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite Johnny Hustle putting in twice as many hours of work, he’s seeing  less than half  the results. So the key here is simple: automate your follow ups.</p>

<p>You might be saying, yea this all sounds good but how does it really work? Well I’m going to walk you through exactly how to setup this system.</p>

<p>First you need to find a tool that can do this. I like to use quickmail because it was created for this exact reason. However, there’s also yesware, and streak which I’ve heard can do similar things.</p>

<p>Another thing about Quickmail that I like is it integrates with Google Spreadsheets, so you can simply drop contact information of your leads into a simple spreadsheet and quickmail takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>Anyways, go ahead and open up Quickmail. Now you COULD set up the perfect template from scratch, but instead I’m going to let you use MY template. Quickmail let’s you do a ONE CLICK copying of my sequence which automatically creates the sequence in your account.</p>

<p>That’s a better place to start. So you’ll notice the initial cold email in the sequence is really basic. That’s by design.</p>

<p>One of the most common problems I see freelancers and agencies run into is that they try to rush the project and close the client all in one foul swoop. This almost never happens. Instead the client gets turned off. Not just because you’re trying to get them to buy your service because everyone is getting them to buy their service.</p>

<p>Remember all the steps we talked about that a project has to go through before it can result in paid work? Don’t rush through these. Make sure to pace the process, make the client understand they can trust you, and spend your time crafting the experience for them.</p>

<p>NOT just rushing to pay me.</p>

<p>So what are some example of this?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that says, “here - get on my calendar. Let’s chat”
(Why would I get on your calendar I don’t know you, or how you’re doing to help me. Are you someone who values your time so little that you jump on calls with complete strangers who you’ve never qualified at all?0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that says, “I can take care of that for you! ”
You haven’t established what my problem even really is, and yet you claim that you can take care of it? You don’t know anything about me. I don’t have any reason to believe that you’ll be able to actually carry through on the promises you’re making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that says “I can get started on Monday, sound good?”
No that doesn’t sound good. That sounds like you’re incredibly pushy. I don’t know anything about you I don’t know what you’ll get started on. It makes me feel like you’re just telling me what I want to hear and this immediately puts me on the defensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that says too much  “anything over 200  words”
It makes me think that you like to hear yourself talk a lot that makes em not want to get on a call with you but it REALLy makes me not want to reply to your email. Why? Because I know I’ll probably get back an even longer wall of text.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that is too literal “you need x, I do x”
That’s just too literal. Yea I said I needed X technology or specialty but that’s not really what I want I want the results that this will give me THAT’s what I really care about. If you can’t relate things back to that then you won’t be able to help me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A first email that’s followed by a “follow up email” within 3 days
Jesus. You JUST emailed me, are you seriously following up THAT quickly? I haven’t even gotten around to reading all the replies I’ve gotten and you’re already following up. OK relax. You just sent me na email this morning. You really think I’ve forgotten about you? Give me about a week to reply.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the ways you can ruin a first email. The keys to keep in mind are this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t rush the process.</li>
  <li>Establish trust first.</li>
  <li>Make it simple to respond.</li>
  <li>Stay in the loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>So here are some general rules for following up via a cold outreach campaign.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep your email to under 200 words</li>
  <li>Send a follow up at least 5 days after your first email</li>
  <li>Break down the sales process into as small of chunks as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you might be wondering about what breaking down the sales process means? For example what about leads that might not be ready for months? How do you talk to them.</p>

<p>That’s what we’ll talk about next.</p>
