    <p>The best way land work in the next 15 minutes, that no one else does</p>

<p>How to use outreach to attract clients rather than chase after them.’</p>

<p>Hey friend,</p>

<p>So I’ve been thinking about where I want to take Workshop in 2016. One idea I’ve been tossing around for a long time is a more hands-on version of the service, where I not only send leads - but even send emails on my clients behalf.</p>

<p>That way you literally have clients coming to you without lifting a finger.</p>

<p>But even with me doing your outreach for you you still wouldn’t see results right away most likely - so I started to ask myself what I could do at the beginning to bring these clients big results quickly.</p>

<p>(After all, this new service would cost a lot more than the current Workshop subscription, so I’d need to make it profitable from day one).</p>

<p>So what would I do?</p>

<p>The first thing I’d do for my clients is follow up with ALL of their past clients.</p>

<p>I’ve observed in my business as well as my friends businesses that this is without a doubt the #1 most unused tactic.</p>

<p>You’re always on the look out for more work. So much so that you forget to follow up with past clients, the people most likely to hire you. Even my extremely successful freelancing friends admit as much. When I shared the idea they said: “Rob, I NEVER FOLLOW UP WITH CLIENTS. If you had something that would help with that I’d throw money at you.”</p>

<p>So while the premium concierge service is in the works, I have something to share with you.</p>

<p>The number 1 thing I would do if I was in your shoes right now to generate more revenue in 2016 is one thing:</p>

<p>Email all of your clients from the past 2-3 years (you can even go beyond this) and write them a simple message. Say the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey [first name], just wanted to follow up and see how your business is doing. Is there anything I can do to help grow your business? Give me a call if you need help :)</p>

  <p>Talk soon, 
[Your name]
[Your Phone Number]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you recently spoke to the client or if you haven’t touched base with them in the past 3 weeks. Send this email. You won’t regret it, I promise.</p>

<p>Your clients won’t be annoyed. They will think you are helpful and considerate.</p>

<p>Best of all it works. You’ll line up work and you’ll find creating repeat clients so much easier than creating new clients.</p>

<p>Once you do this once, make it habit. Set a reminder to follow up with every single client again in 3 months. That’s how you create a recurring stream of clients coming to you.</p>

<p>That’s it for today. Report back with your results.</p>

<p>Robert</p>
