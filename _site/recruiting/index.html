    <p>You know those rotten emails you get from recruiters. The ones that instantly make you roll your eyes so hard you can see your brain. Yea you do, because everyone does. We all agree these are the worst emails on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>If I was Kanye West, I’d interrupt the bad email awards and give a shoutout to recruiters because they have some of the worst emails of all time.</p>

<p>Yet they continue to be sent. I have an inbox full of these spammy emails. I could take a screenshot of them and break down exactly why they’re so bad.</p>

<p>But that won’t really help. Instead, with the help of <a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/">my friend Alex Hillman</a>, here’s a list of ways to improve recruiter emails (which, if you haven’t noticed, are shockingly similar to bad freelancer emails).</p>

<p>Alex sees recruiting companies come into his coworking space all the time. Recently he broke it down for me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the heart of the problem is really the fact that the emails sound… desperate. I don’t know any other way to say it. And relationships that begin out of desperation… well they basically never end well. Anybody worth their rate is going to be asking questions like:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Who is this agency that wants to hire me, why am I hearing from you and not them?</li>
    <li>Wait, who are you? Why should I trust you? The only time I hear from you is when one of your clients is in a panic.</li>
    <li>Why is this project suddenly missing a developer that they surely had to know they’d need to finish it?</li>
    <li>How do I know if this is going to be worth my time?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You’re in the relationship business, which actually means you’re in the TRUST business. And your emails aren’t conveying your trustworthiness, or your clients’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you read these questions, they seem logical. “Duh, every recruiter should know this stuff instinctively and stop being such a filthy spammer!” But what about you. Do you ask these questions when you send emails to clients or potential clients?</p>
