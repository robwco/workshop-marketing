</div>

<div class="space-p max-w-md mx-auto text-xl leading-normal text-grey-darker mb-8">
  <p>I hear that all the time when I ask freelance frontend designers about dry spells. And they’re right. You land more work when you’re in front of the right clients more often.</p>

  <p>But it’s a time suck to separate the right opportunities from the wrong ones all by yourself. There’s thousands of opportunities online waiting to be discovered.</p>

  <p>Still, it takes sifting through old emails, job posts, tweets, forums, and more. It takes so long that nearly everyone avoids it.</p>

  <p>The fact is, job boards aren’t designed for freelance frontend designers — and if you’re loaded with billable work, you don’t have time to sort through them every day — so you never hear about 90% of the opportunities out there.</p>

  <p>Worse, once you’re finished with a project, and have all this time again, you’re left scrambling to find work. That leads to wasted time – or accepting work from bad clients (just so you can pay the bills).</p>

<p>“On the first day I used it, I contacted 3 prospective clients and got three emails back. One of those turned into a solid gig. It's totally worth it so far.</p>

<p class="mt-2">A big reason why is that I know they'll be 100% freelance-friendly frontend leads and I don't have to do any thinking about whether it makes sense for me to apply or not. Thanks for creating Workshop!”</p>

  <h2 class="leading-tight my-4">Frontend design firms, you don't have to live with feast or famine anymore...</h2>

  <p>Here’s the facts: it’s way more effective to strategically contact a few opportunities every week, instead of waiting until your schedule (or wallet) is empty to drunkenly spray out cold emails to a flurry of people.</p>

  <p>But finding the right leads takes time (at least a few hours a day) and as a freelance frontend designer/developer, an hour of your time alone is worth close to $100. That means you’re looking at a loss of over $2,000+ billable time per month!</p>

  <p><strong>In a perfect world, great leads would come to you. Allowing you to save time, and get right to the important part: pitching clients and landing contracts.</strong></p>

  <p>How much would making that happen cost you? If you paid someone $10/hour, and they spent 2 hours a day gathering leads, you’d be looking at $600/month.</p>

  <p>That’s too much money. Finding someone on upwork for cheap is even worse because who knows if they’ll be able to even help you find a good freelance prospect (plus who wants to support <em>upwork</em>.)</p>

  <p>Instead, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can pay for all of the weeks best frontend design leads. Ask anyone who’s hired lead gen like this, and they’ll say it’s usually really expensive, like 30% of your total sales. So if you landed a $10,000 contract, they might ask for $3,000!</p>

  <p>I have something better: for a small monthly fee, you’ll get the best frontend design leads sent to your inbox, every day. You don’t pay any commission at all!</p>

  <p>Allowing you to affordably generate a consistent cash flow for your business.</p>

  <p>Instead of spending your time looking for leads (or hiring someone expensive to do it), I’ll simply do it for you and email you the good stuff a couple times a week.</p>

  <p>All you have to do is send a couple short personal emails every few days to have multiple sales conversations going on at all times. This will let you focus the rest of your time exclusively on billable tasks.</p>

You've proven to be a low-risk way to get more leads to my door and as a busy owner, you're exactly the type of person I want to work with for a long time. Please don't stop!”</p>

  <p>Here’s some of the job boards I will automatically comb through everyday and cherry-pick the best to send you (I’m constantly adding new sources all the time!):</p>

<h3 class="my-4 max-w-md mx-auto text-center text-grey-darkest text-3xl">Thinking about signing up? Cool! Here's what you might be wondering about...</h3>

<div class="border-4 text-grey-darker my-4">
	<div class="border-b-4 p-4 bg-grey-lighter">
		<p class="text-xl">Can I just find these leads myself, for free?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="border-b-4 p-4">
		<p>Yes, you can. But you haven't, and you never will. Committing to finding a set of leads day-in and day-out is tough, and intuitively you know your time is too valuable for that.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="border-b-4 p-4 bg-grey-lighter">
		<p class="text-xl">What kind of results can I expect? Will this replace my sales funnel?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="border-b-4 p-4">
		<p>No, this isn't a replacement for your entire pipeline. This is just a way to start conversations and meet  people outside of your network with active gigs. You can't stop all other regular sales activity. Workshop's delivery of 10-30 monthly outbound leads work best with a healthy dose (5-10) inbound leads. Think of it as a leisurely way to supplement your sales funnel and you'll be fine.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="p-4 bg-grey-lighter border-b-4">
		<p class="text-xl">What kind of leads will you send me?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="p-4 border-b-4">
		<p>Workshop is focused on contract frontend design gigs. We find most of our leads on job boards (amidst thousands of full-time gigs). We verify that each lead includes an email address, a realistic project outline, and is open to remote contract-based work. Members say that the leads I send reply at a higher rate than outreach they've done in the past.</p> 
		
		<p class="mt-2">But they also have an unfair advantage. Job boards and prospecting no longer suck up all their billable time, so they're better at contacting leads because they no longer teeter-totter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs from Workshop's emails. All have saved the most precious thing of all; time.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="p-4 bg-grey-lighter border-b-4">
		<p class="text-xl">I’m outside of the US, is that a problem?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="p-4 border-b-4">
		<p>Not at all. If you have a solid grasp of the english language you can and will win work from these leads. Workshop has top freelancers from all over the world, including places like Europe, Asia, and basically every other continent in the world who are loving the service. All leads are 100% remote and open to remote freelancers anywhere in the world, so I’d suggest you sign up and see if it’ll work for you.</p>

	<div class="p-4 bg-grey-lighter border-b-4">

	</div>
	
	<div class="p-4 border-b-4">
		<p>Workshop is about less. Allowing you to do less and get better results. So it's just as much about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important. The fact is you don't need all that many leads to make a lot of money; you just need the right leads. You can email me for a sample of leads.</p>
