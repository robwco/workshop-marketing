    <p>The worthless spammer. The thought alone of being called one paralyzes us and stops us from emailing someone.</p>

<p>It’s for good reason too. You hate spam. There’s nothing worse than receiving another worthless spammy email. The thought of actually sending one out yourself <em>should</em> give you shivers.</p>

<p>It’s also the first thing busy people look to eliminate when going through their inbox. There’s nothing better than getting spam out of your life. It offers nothing.</p>

<p>So, when you’re looking for freelance work, sending out an email that’s very clearly not spam is key to getting through. It’s also something freelancers don’t do very well.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever posted on a job board, you know you get a t-t-ton of spam. The thing is freelancers don’t know they’re sending it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jadottedesign.com/">Stephanie Jadotte</a> is a freelance brand and print designer in Florida. Despite doing great work and having an active Workshop subscription feeding her leads, she was having trouble winning work.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter how many emails she sent, or what she tried, almost no opportunities would come of it.</p>

<p>So we worked together on her cold emails, and discovered something. Although she was spending a lot of time writing emails, they were all almost identical.</p>

<p>Worse, they all started almost the exact same way and got her no follow up emails.</p>

<p>That’s when she realized she was basically sending spam: the same unsolicited email to a ton of people.</p>

<p>To her credit, that’s when she mixed things up. She decided that instead of worrying about how many people she contacted per month or following a script or template, she would focus on sending one great email per day.</p>

<p>The result was the following awesome email:</p>

<p><img src="/images/stephanie-spam.png" alt="Stephanie Jadotte's great email" /></p>

<p>30 minutes after sending it off Stephanie got a response from Ron. He was eager to see if she had new ideas.</p>

<p>Let’s analyze why this happened. Stephanie distanced herself from the spammers by doing a little extra effort. Not only did she do enough background research on Ron and his company to discover he wrote a book. She bought and read the book!</p>

<p>This allowed her to write an email that could literally only be sent to one person in the entire world, Ron.</p>

<p>She also got a reply from Ron, in under an hour.</p>

<p>As a freelancer, you only need a handful of clients. Use that to your advantage.</p>

<p>When emailing potential freelance clients, your cold email has to immediately identify itself as NOT spam. If it could only be send to one person in the world, you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>That’s just one of the checklist items that I included in my new Cold Freelance Email Checklist. Each one was discovered after analyzing over 1000+ freelancer emails. I’ll be sending it over to you shortly if you bought the book but you can get it now for free by <a href="http://letsworkshop.com">signing up in the bottom right corner here.</a></p>
