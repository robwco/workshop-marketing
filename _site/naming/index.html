		<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">How do you name a product?</h1>
    <p>I get asked about how I named Workshop pretty often. The truth is I came up with the name Workshop before I even had the idea for the service. I thought it would make a cool name for something.</p>

<p>Why did it sound cool to me? I don’t know. Part gut-feeling. Part being easy to remember. The fun part was once I had the idea for the service and needed a name, I remembered it.</p>

<p>It happened to work on multiple levels. A ‘workshop’ is a place people go to manufacture goods. It’s a place people go to work. People join my service to go to work also.</p>

<p>Plus, people use it to shop for work, so like a tire-shop sells tires, I sell work.</p>

<p>Although I’m glad the name works, it wasn’t pre-meditated. That’s one piece of advice I give people who are starting something new and stressing out about the name.</p>

<p>Worry about the product or service first. Let that guide the name, and don’t over think it.</p>

<p>If you’re buying a domain before you’ve even really mapped out the idea, you’re probably on the wrong track. Take a step back and focus on solving something. The name will come.</p>
