<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;"> Hiring a great freelancer online is hard: 90% of responses you'll get are spam.</h1>
That’s why looking for a freelancer on a job board is a gamble at best. Picking from a list of shady freelancers means betting thousands of dollars on someone you don't trust.

See, the truth is free job boards and other job sites attract freelancers who don’t value their time. These “freelancers” are willing to battle at the bottom of the barrel.

Plus, these sites cost a lot – often more than $300+ per listing – and you don't get much in return. Every reply will say they can do what you’re asking, yet 99% will fail to deliver. With those numbers, your odds of a successful project take a big hit.

## But what if your job post wasn’t plastered around for every slimy internet marketer to see?

What if you could choose from the best? What if you found a place where freelancers had to pay for the privilege to talk with you? It would mean freelancers have a skin in the game. 

It would mean freelancers would no longer contact you unless it was a perfect fit. It would mean freelancers would be so focused on delivering value they prove it from the very first email (instead of just claiming it). 

It would mean you found Workshop. Submit your project below and I'll send your project to a paying list of great freelancers.
