title: Emails That Win You Clients
permalink: /course/
---

# If you're not booked 4-6 months in advance you're at risk of a dry spell.
If you're like me, when you see an email from a potential client you feel a small rush of excitement. For a second you really believe you might have hit the client jackpot and that amazing fulfilling client work awaits you. 

Unfortunately that feeling usually goes away rather quickly... and sometimes doesn't come back for weeks or months. We call those dry spells. 

## With so much of your joy and success hinging on your email, why do you let your inbox become a graveyard for freelance work? 

The truth is most freelancers feel anxious about their inbox and for good reason. If I looked in your email right now, what would I see?

You'd probably have a bunch of folders with cobwebs on them, emails crammed all over the place, and no real strategy to how you utilize your inbox ... just like most freelancers.

Even thinking about it now probably makes you uncomfortable.

Consider the fact that virtually all of your new business opportunities are born and live here. Whether it's a new client, referral work, or past clients - most of them will approach you *via email.*

So your anxiety is well placed. Your inbox HAS to be affecting your business. It HAS to have a direct correlation on how much you make. And if it's not properly utilized, you're leaving money on the table.

## When was the last time you focused on improving your email skills? 
Sure you're constantly learning about design, development, or whatever you're passionate about but do those things have the direct correlation to your bottom line as email?

I'd argue email is equally as important, yet most of us never focus on improving it as a skill – and the truth is our professional lives are a roller coaster of worry because of it. 

Opportunities come and go. You feel unorganized. You have this terrible feeling that you might be dropping the ball all of the time. 

The worst part is you accept your situation as the nature of the business.

## Cold hard fact 1: You don't have a system for handling email so you forget important shit (like who's interested, who you've already emailed, who you need to follow up with, etc).

That's why you feel like you're dropping the ball constantly.

The truth is this is bound to happen. You're just one person. It's not possible to remember every little detail about everything you should be doing for your business. 

Still, there's no denying that when you go to sleep your business stops. When you don't find and email new leads your phone doesn't ring. If I were to take you away from your business for a few weeks, it wouldn't survive very long.

It would fall into a dry spell. It would be lost without you. 

But what do you think happens when you're working full time on a project and you don't have time to look for work? The same thing happens: your business comes to a sudden stop. 

That's why you need to have a system that's on autopilot. A system that wont cripple your business because you go to bed. A system that allows your business to keep running with or without you. 

Because you are a one person business, and no one else will market it for you.

## Cold hard fact 2: You don't know what to say to potential clients in your cold emails so you let opportunities slip away from companies you could have helped.
Companies everywhere are looking for a freelancer like you – everyday you see job posts, tweets, and other opportunities go by.

You know you can help these companies, why does contacting them feel spammy? Worse, why don't they respond to your emails?

One thing is for sure: you don't want to be that spammy guy. You hate the thought of sending a bunch of shitty emails, crossing your fingers and hoping you'll hear back. 

But when you sit down to write it that's exactly what comes out. So you tense up. A surge of ideas hit you. You want to encapsulate every bit of yourself in your email.

Every word you write makes you feel less confident. Before you know it, you’ve re-written your email a hundred times and you're still not happy. Staring at a blank screen, you ask yourself:

- “What should I say first?”
- “What if I sound spammy?”
- “How do I frame myself?”
- “What’s the right tone for this email?”

You don't know the answers so you highlight it all and hit delete. It's only a few more seconds before you give up and close the tab. You asked yourself the wrong questions.

## Cold hard fact 3: You spend too much time rewriting the same emails and it's crippling your productivity and effectiveness.

You've probably discovered by now that a shocking amount of your time and business is spent just sending emails. 

Because of this you know your business is unavoidably tied to the success of those emails. In other words you live and die by the emails you write. 

If you're an average freelancer you send over 10,000 emails per year. At that volume you repeat yourself a lot. 

By the 13th time you ask someone for a referral you undoubtably start to half-ass it. 

Why does it have to be this way? Shouldn't every client get your best? Why can't every email you write put you in the best position possible?

There's only so many different types of emails you need to send. You ask for testimonials, you send cold emails, you ask for referrals, yet each time you write one of these emails for the millionth time, you feel yourself slipping. 

I know, I hate it too. 

## But instead of sitting and waiting for your next client to appear, what if you could turn on client work whenever you wanted?

What if you knew the exact recipe for writing a perfect email? What if you only sent emails that gave you the best chance at landing a client?

What if you didn't want to wait for work to come to you anymore? What if you wanted to be a top freelancer that attracts work strategically and automatically?

What if you could skip the years of trial and error and just send amazing emails all of the time and on-demand? What if you could leap-frog all those freelancers on hacker news that say dry spells are just a part of the game?

Imagine effortlessly writing the perfect email to any client, by following a step-by-step guide.

Better yet, imagine if by doing this you could double the number of inquiries you got, warm leads, referrals, testimonials, awesome client feedback and more... overnight. 

If you could unlock the most fulfilling, meaningful freelance work of your career – what would it mean to your business?

It would mean more clients and access to better, more profitable projects. Best of all, it would mean working less and getting more out of your time.

## You get the Emails That Win Audio Masterclass
<img src="/images/strat.png" style="width: 15em; margin-right: 1em;" align="left">
The Emails That Win Masterclass is a comprehensive course containing audio, detailed notes, and insider information about the exact steps you need to take to make your freelancing more profitable. 

Most freelancers struggle for one reason and one reason only. Because they approach freelancing without a foundation of customer psychology.

This lack of understanding means they struggle to hear back from clients they approach, and clients don't approach them. The problem isn't the quality of work you do. It's that you're bad at writing emails. 

I can help  you send better emails and unlock your dream business. h



This lack of this psychology means the website owner needs to drive tens of thousands of prospects to his/her website to make the website profitable. And even if you do drive those herds of prospects, there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy anything at all.

And this need to have to drive a constant stream of customers, ends up with the website owner doing a lot of legwork. He/she has to be constantly advertising; constantly doing joint ventures; constantly travelling and speaking; constantly working and consequently going a little nuts if everything turns to custard.

What do Paul Jarvis, Nick Disabato, Jarrod Drysdale, Samuel Hulick, Kurt Elster, Alex Hillman, Kai Davis and Michael Alexis all have in common?

They've all built 6-figure consulting practices. They've built businesses that most freelancers only dream of.

This course comes from a 12-month long series of strategy sessions with over 50+ freelancers who were struggling to hear back from clients. Every one of these freelancers began to see results as soon as they implemented the material. Leads began responding. They started winning clients.

Here's what's covered:


This course is designed to be a companion to your email writing process. It’s intended to be something you can open up next to gmail and refer back to whenever you want. It's a resources you can look at quickly and know you're sending out a great email every time.

To help you find what you’re looking for quickly, I made stuff easy to find. How to start writing is at the beginning. How to end emails is at the end.

In the last year, I've helped dozens of freelancers like you make hundreds of thousands of dollars from emailing freelance leads.

That's great, but that's not the whole story. There was also another group. This one made nothing. Despite reaching out to the same opportunities, they couldn't land work. Don't be in the second group.

- Don't make the same mistakes when contacting companies:
- Don't offer nothing compelling.
- Don't blab on for too long, not knowing when to end an email.
- Don't sound like a robot.
- Don't come off spammy.

Could well-crafted messages improve your freelance business?

Since jumping feet first into consulting five years ago, I've discovered that a shocking amount of my time and my business is spent just sending emails. As a percentage of time, I'd say my business (and yours) is unavoidably tied to the success of those emails.

As principal of a web development agency, I live & die by email - last year, I sent 11,448 of them. In that time, I've tested dozens of email templates (with dozens of variations) to find the most effective, persuasive, and concise emails. The result is consistently professional correspondence, and that means more profit.

By using the very same email templates I use in my business, you'll be able to save yourself hours spent in your inbox, decrease response times, and even fight scope creep.

Here's what other freelance business owners have had to say about Email Templates For Freelancers:

What's the perfect email? The right message at the right time said with the right tone. Language that keeps you from giving the farm away, keeps your clients happy, and gets $#!& DONE. Every page of this book got me closer than I ever have been to effective email nirvana. Thanks Kurt!
–Philip Morgan, My Drip Sherpa
Kurt taught me the magic email, which has a running success rate of about 95%; therefore, in my eyes he is the Godfather of all things email.
–Michael Steele, The Bright Agency
Kurt is on a roll with his second product, this one is an absolute goldmine for any freelancer. These templates will save you dozens of hours of time, while boosting your bottom line. And the best part, is that they are tried and tested, proven lines straight from Kurt's own successful agency business.
–Chad Fullerton, Founder: Freelancer's Networking Group

Put Your Lead Gen on Autopilot with Drip Email



## Premium Only: The Video Course on automating this entire system so you can sell to more prospects and clients while you sleep
<img src="/images/video-course.png" style="width: 20em;">

- Customer service consisting of follow-ups and check-ins
- Valuable info (to keep building trust and authority)
- Up-sells and info about other services and packages

The common thread behind all of my marketing effort is value.  This setup has allowed me to deliver so much more value that the quality of clients I work with, amount of work I have, and my freelancing rate has improved accordingly (almost with no added effort on my end).

So long as I’m constantly delivering value in the form of either literal return on investment for clients or actionable advice for growing a business to prospects, I know I’ll keep succeeding. My favorite aphorism being “a rising tide lifts all boats.”


Now after Kurt completely productized his freelance services and automated his buying cycle with Drip, he literally stepped back and documented exactly how he did it.

He's created a course that walks you through the exact steps you can take for yourself to follow in his footsteps.

I took the course and was blown away. It's called Drip profits and it gives you the keys to providing ridiculous amounts of value to your clients, effortlessly.


I really wanted to promote this thing to you guys because I know how much it'll help ANY FREELANCE BUSINESS, so I talked him into giving you a sweet discount. 

You can buy it now and get $20 off – it's the best way to automate filling your sales pipeline that I've seen.

This coupon will last 48 hours: letsworkshop

Make sure you do yourself a favor and buy this course now. Even if you're busy with client work right at the moment, make time to implement this course soon. Kurt should really be charging 3-4x the current price... and will probably raise the price soon.

It's a guaranteed investment that will easily double or triple your consulting revenue in just a few hours.


What if you could build a source of income without having to find new clients, that consistently brought you new projects automatically without you having to lift a finger?

How about keeping your clients happier than ever by connecting with them regularly, all automatically?

In this course I will show you step-by-step exactly how to start generating leads for your business on a daily basis while you sleep. The best part is that you could be fully setup in an afternoon.

How do I know it'll work? It's the very same system I used last year to get so many clients and projects that I grew my revenue by 8x. I literally booked myself solid, without networking or cold calls.

## “So what happens if I don’t like it?”

No worries. There’s a 30-day 100% satisfaction guarantee.

Enjoy the course for a full month and if you don’t like it for any reason, send me an email and I’ll give you a refund. I don’t want your money if you’re not 100% blown away.

## “My schedule is fully booked. Should I still buy it?”

Yes, here’s why: it’s a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen because we fail to line up work during flush times (times when we’re loaded with work) NOT only during dry spells.

Just because you have work now it doesn’t give you the right to put your hands up and stop all sales activity. On the contrary. Now is when you should start a small daily amount of activity to ensure you never run out of work again.

If you’re not booked at least 4-6 months in advanced, it’s a sign you’re susceptible to a dry spell.

## “I just started freelancing. What if I’m not ready?”

I guarantee that if you can build a website, design, or code - at any level - you can also make a lot of money from Workshop today.

But it takes investing in yourself now.

It doesn’t matter how much experience you have, the habits you build into your business now will stay with you for a long time (maybe forever).

That’s why it’s important that you push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

Leveling up your consulting business isn’t about planning for the future. It’s about taking small steps right now that will ensure you’re in the best position to succeed.

## “But will Emails That Win work for me? I specialize in X.”

Yes. Emails that win is a course mostly focused on web design and web development - however the concepts inside it can be applied to any business or even day job. 

The amount of email you send don't just happen behind the scenes. They're the key to all kinds of new opportunities. You'll see a dramatic shift in other areas of your life.

If you’re still worried there may not be enough of your type of lead, the best advice I can give is to try it. There’s a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee for this exact reason.

Sign up for yourself and see.

## Will the book have scripts? 
Yes. I love examples and will include many breakdowns of emails. However, I believe that scripts and templates almost always encourage writing bad emails. 

They’re formulaic and people can smell a form email coming from a mile away. So my hope is that while you can certainly use these examples in your daily life, you also learn the thought process behind why they're written the way they are.

## Is this for me? What if english isn’t my first language?
Great emails are simple. It doesn’t matter if your grammar is perfect, as long as you can write clearly. I’ll teach you to sum up what you need to say.

## Who are you?
Robert Williams and Kurt Elster. Robert started Workshop, a service that helps freelancers find work, over a year ago and Kurt runs a consultancy full-time. 

Our goal is to help you crystalize what your dream job means to you, and help you get there.

## I still have a question?
No problemo, email me here: [robert@letsworkshop.com](MAILTO:robert@letsworkshop.com) and I’ll get back to you shortly, take care!

> Consultants miss out on work because we botch the client relationship. Not because we aren’t skilled enough or don’t have an impressive portfolio; simply because we are horrible at selling our services. This book made a huge difference in how I communicate with clients. I’ve learned how to take control of the conversation and truly act the expert.
>
> Writing emails to freelance leads is a horrible, soul-sucking grind. It’s even worse when you don’t book a project after sending dozens of emails. I want to book projects, not be a full time, email sending robot. After following Robert’s advice, I’m spending less time writing email but booking more projects.”

### Why I think you should buy right now
As a freelancer, right now is when you should do something. Waiting is almost guaranteed to hurt your business forever. See, It's a common misconception that dry spells are a part of freelancing. The truth is they happen because we sit and wait.

Failing to line up work during flush times (not dry spells), is the real reason you run into feast or famine cycles. Just because you have work now, you're short on time, or you have some other excuse, you shouldn't put your hands up and stop sales activity.

On the contrary, now is when you should find next month or next year's client. I don't want you to wait until it's too late, and in order to prove it I'm willing to take away all of the risk. You can get 100% of your money back if you don't like it, at any time.

See like you, I know there are a ton of businesses who will benefit from working with me. Only you know the vision you had when you decided to strike out on your own and start your freelance consulting business. My goal is to help you reach that vision.

Warm Regards,
