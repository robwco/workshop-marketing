# Terms of Service
Here’s how it works. You alone are responsible for your actions and the results of your freelance business, which depend on personal factors such as your skill, abilities, knowledge, connections, and financial situation, just to name a few.

I offer no warranties or guarantees regarding results. When addressing financial matters, I’ve taken every effort to ensure I accurately represent the service and it’s ability to enhance your freelancing business. 

However, by purchasing this service, you accept and agree that you are fully responsible for your progress and results (and those results will obviously vary). 

Any statements outlined are my opinion and thus are not guarantees or promises of actual performance. And if you have a question, ask it.

### Refunds

I don't offer refunds with one exception: if service is denied because I don't think I can help you, I will refund your entire purchase. Denial is based on my discretion.

**Note about refunds:** The reason I don't offer a money-guarantee on my service is because as soon as you pay I'm using your fee to provide the service. 

That means I'm paying my team, allotting time in my schedule for you, and enhancing my system and service to provide the best results I can for you. 

Those investments mean I can't get that time back and it would not be fair to ask my team to take on that risk either.
