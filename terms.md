Here's how it works. *You alone are responsible* for your actions and the results of your freelance business, which depend on personal factors including your skills, abilities, knowledge, connections, and financial situation, just to name a few.

I offer no warranties or guarantees regarding results. When addressing financial matters, I've taken every effort to ensure I accurately represent the service and it's ability to enhance your freelancing business. However, by purchasing this service, you accept and agree that you are fully responsible for your progress and results (and those results will obviously vary). 

Any statements outlined are my opinion and thus are not guarantees or promises of actual performance. And if you have a question, ask it.
