## About me and my service

<img src="/images/rob-shades.jpg" align="left" style="width: 150px; border-radius: 150px; margin-right: 1em;">
Hi! I'm Robert Williams and I run Workshop. It's a service I started in November 2013 because I wished I could hire someone to find me leads. I love chatting about consulting, design, and business so [get in touch](MAILTO:julie@letsworkshop.com) about guest posts, podcasts or any other fun opportunities.
