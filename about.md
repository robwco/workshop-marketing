I believe in sharing the tools I use with others. Screenflow for videos. Jekyll for blogging. Typekit for hosting fonts. Icons by [Iconmnster](https://iconmonstr.com). My email list uses [Drip](https://www.drip.co/?campaignid=1727&mbsy_source=53bdc04a-1bab-4e5e-a8f5-07349ed3737f&mbsy=bH3VW). Keynote for PDF guides. 

We're not on Facebook. Fuck Facebook. We hate Facebook. 

Twitter is meh.
