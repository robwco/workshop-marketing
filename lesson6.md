<h1 class="leading-tight font-medium text-3xl mt-8">Hack's for cutting down UX design lead finding time</h1>

So after implementing my last lesson, you've now gotten your Feedbin account setup and are seeing dozens of leads daily. Congrats.


Now you have a complete system for finding, qualifying, and putting aside great freelance jobs in a way that's 90% hands-off.


This daily flow of leads is enough to fill the gaps in most pipelines. Next I want to show you how I handle another type of lead source. 

Infrequent and ad-hoc lead finding 

Now I want to share a few pro-tips with you for making this entire thing even more profitable for you.

To break up the grind of automation you need to do some lead-finding on your own. A great way is reminders for niche websites.

With job boards covered, you have a big portion of the web's frontend design opportunities coming to you. 

However, there's a few more places that are worth your time - outside of the job board spectrum.

For example, Hacker News.

Once a month, Hacker News has a freelance hiring frenzy known as the monthly "Seeking Freelancer" thread.

This is where startups from Ycombinator and other places come to share opportunities, refer work, and hire freelancers of all types. 

It's usually a really high-quality source of work because there's a short-hand amongst your peers here. Typically these projects are focused on solving really interesting problems and the budgets can be quite high.

Most of these posts will simply ask you to email them so there's very little barrier and a friendly, well-worded email can mean thousands of dollars in project work.

However, this isn't a good candidate for RSS because there's no way to track the thread each month. 

What I recommend instead is setting up a reminder (Basecamp's automatic questions feature is good for this) that reminds you to check for this occurrence at the start of each month.

Since Hacker News doesn't offer RSS feeds, this will let you stay on top of these great opportunities without having to remember by yourself.

This is what I recommend for various other sites. Let's quickly walk through a few more recurring reminders I have setup in Basecamp (you can set a reminder like this in any app).

Check Facebook for design RFP once a week

More and more companies are posting links to RFPs on Facebook. You can search Facebook using this link. 

Just type the keyword RFP and set the date to this month. You'll find some opportunities here that you otherwise would miss. 

It's a similar process for 

Check Google for design RFPs once a week

Check Lever and Workable for freelance gigs once a week

Pro-tip:Â Look for communities specific to your discipline or specialty. Each one has their own way of posting opportunities so study up and add a reminder once you've found a recurring source you want to keep track of. 

Some ideas for this type of activity:

- Slack communities
- Subreddits
- Google alerts

Hopefully you're beginning to see how email alerts from sites like AngelList, automtically curated feeds from job sites with Feedbin, and one-off remidners to check niche communities and websites, can create an infinietely powerful source of work that can supercharge your concsulting practice. 

There's one type of site you might have noticed I left out. Job sites like Upwork are popular but have a nasty secret.

Ready to see what that is?
