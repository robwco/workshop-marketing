</div>

If you go on hacker or designer news they will tell you feast or famine is just a part of freelancing. Bruh. Not true. There's a better way to run your business.

Finding clients to reach out to is just one part of this. This process is not meant to be the only way you find clients, however it is a good place to start. Outside of finding clients on your own, an ideal well-positioned frontend design firm will have clients coming to them as well.

Below is my blueprint for finding over 200 high-quality frontend design projects leads each month. 

I know what you're saying. Yeah right. How could these beauties be hidden in plain sight when so many freelancers out there are struggling to pay their rent? I don't know. Probably because they're too busy checking twitter all the time or redesigning their portfolio. 

I do know this: this system results in paid gigs. How? Because I rely on it daily to provide gigs to cash-paying customers of [my frontend design leads subscription service](/leads). It's resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars for them, and happy customers for me - so I know it works. 

They keep coming back and I keep finding them great clients day after day. Note: although the process below is tuned for frontend design firms, you can probably use it to find leads for your firm's specialty as well. Enjoy!

<h2 class="text-grey-darkest mt-4 mb-2">Getting Started: The Overview</h2>

The way this entire system is going to work is: you're going to collect possible gigs from hundreds of different websites, use automation to remove as much of what you don't want as possible, and put the remaining stuff all in one place, ideally your inbox.

<ol class="mb-4">
	<li>Part one of this process is going to be RSS-based.</li>
	<li>Part two is going to be email-based. </li>
</ol>

<p class="font-bold mt-8 block">What part one will look like: Using RSS</p>

<img src="/images/rss-based.png" class="w-full mx-auto block mt-4 mb-8">

To do this we're going to use some magical tools. 

The first thing you're going to need is an RSS reader. I've tried half a dozen RSS readers and most don't do exactly what we need. That's why I'm really excited to have found the absolute perfect RSS reader... [feedbin](http://feedbin.com). 

<strong class="text-grey-darkest">Note:</strong> This is a totally independent endorsement, I get nothing out of you using it, however it's simply the best tool I've found for reviewing RSS job sites.

Part two is going to be slightly different for independent websites.

<img src="/images/vertical-rule.png" class="w-full mx-auto block">

<h2 class="mt-8 text-grey-darkest leading-tight">Step 1: create a Feedbin account</h2>

As mentioned above my recommended RSS reader is: Feedbin. However, you can use other tools it just won't be as good. There's always [feedly](http://feedly.com) (which is free but kind of sucks, your call).

<div class="flex max-w-md mx-auto my-8 py-6 shadow-lg rounded-lg p-4">

		<p class="text-grey-darkest text-md leading-tight font-bold mb-2">:trophy: <a href="http://feedbin.com">Best RSS Reader: Feedbin</a></p>
		<p class="text-grey-darker text-sm">I can't tell you how much time I've saved because of this app. I strongly recommend Feedbin for this process. It's the only RSS reader I've found that can create rules and actions for specific websites. A+</p>
	</div>

<h2 class="mt-8 text-grey-darkest leading-tight">Step 2: Add frontend job feeds to Feedbin</h2>
This is probably going to be the longest part of the entire process. You need to find every job site on the that has frontend gigs coming to it. Next, you'll find the RSS feed for each one and add it to feedbin.

If they don't have one, you can also create one, which I outline below. Luckily, most job sites have a pretty easy to find RSS feed. 

To make the entire process even easier for you, I offer my own list of RSS feeds I use here. 

<strong class="text-grey-darkest">Which sites do I recommend you start with?</strong>

<h3>AngelList</h3>

On AngelList you’ll find hundreds of projects from startups all over the world. It’s my favorite place to find work because companies here are experienced and comfortable working with remote freelancers – and typically have realistic budgets. Use AngelList’s built-in email alert feature because they don’t currently support RSS. Use the tags “Contract”, “Remote OK”, and “freelance” along with your specialty to find project-based work you can do from anywhere.
