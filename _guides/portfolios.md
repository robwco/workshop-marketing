Stop spending so much time on your portfolio and sending it to every prospect. It's not the key to getting clients you think it is. 

Most clients don't care about your work. They care about themselves. They want to solve their problems. Not look at a stupid portfolio.  

So don't agonize over it. Don't expect your work to speak for itself. 

Instead get good at selling yourself with your writing and ideas. 

Publish an email course. Write a series of blog posts. Talk about how you solve problems. That's what matters.
