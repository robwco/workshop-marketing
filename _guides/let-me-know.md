Enough with "let me know..." 

It's at the bottom of every email. Our brains are numb to it. 

It's what you write when you get to the bottom of an email and don't know what to say. 

- "Let me know if this works for you"
- "Let me know how we should move forward"
- "Let me know if you think we might be a fit"

Enough. 

It's not considerate. You're not letting the client get what they want, you're creating more work for them. 

It reeks of incompetence and it undermines your business. Clients are paying you to solve problems. Let me know trashes this responsibility. 

Instead suggest the next step. Don't say you want a meeting, suggest a time. Don't ask for feedback, guide it. Set the tone that you're capable of making the right decision instead of needing a client to hold your hand.
