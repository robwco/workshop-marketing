**Summary:** Reduce time wasted on laborious tasks that have no impact on results. This includes finding RFP's, designing / writing proposals, and following up by hand. Instead, automate and make phone calls.

## Wait, are RFPs even worth it?

Ahh, RFPs. Unless you have a lot of experience responding to them, they can be down-right intimidating. 

Of course, it's always better to get work by referral BUT simply responding to 1-2 RFPs per week can mean millions of dollars in added revenue for *not that much extra effort*. 

That's a great opportunity.

And with the right approach, you can reduce the intimidation factor substantially.

This guide will show you how to do that and create a system that takes just 1 – 2 hours a week to manage. I guarantee you'll be able to reply to projects (with realistic budgets and great people at the helm) no matter how busy you are.

### So how can I make RFPs suck less?

RFPs suck because they're time consuming. 

Often there's not a lot of feedback involved in the process (or you don't take advantage of there feedback loop that's there) and you're left feeling like you just sent a carefully crafted proposal into a black hole of emptiness.

These failed proposals feel like you never had a shot in the first place and all the work you did was completely pointless. 

However, the keyword here is feel because they're actually not that pointless of an activity. They just feel that way. The truth is if you do some simple math, you actually have a pretty good shot at landing an RFP. 

As a point of reference, most RFP issuers I've interviewed received less than 30 proposals total. 

If you're just average at sending proposals (and respond to one a week) that means you're guaranteed to land a couple gigs from RFPs every year. 

That's not a bad ROI as long as responding to one per week doesn't make you hate your life. 

So let's talk about how to make the process a lot easier.

## Make it easy on yourself, re-use elements of your proposals

The truth is most RFPs ask for the exact same things. 

RFP specifications are so similar in fact, you can apply to 90% of them with almost an identical proposal.

Instead of wasting time remaking your proposal from scratch, you can create a great proposal once that you re-use forever.

So what are some elements you should have ready to go?

### How to save hours on RFPs: Re-use these elements

I've compiled the most most common specifications you'll be asked to provide based on over 500 RFPs. Have these ready to go and you'll save you a ton of time.

</div>


<div class="element">
<h3>:email: Cover letter</h3>
Introduce yourself and your services in a friendly and concise way.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:nail_care: Bio</h3>
Most RFPs want to know who's behind the proposal. Have a bio ready to go that tells them why you're awesome.
</div>


<div class="element">
<h3>:telephone_receiver: Contact Info</h3>
Don't forget to include how they can contact you. Ideally try to include this on every page.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:beers: Team members</h3>
Who's going to be working on the project? What are their roles. You can have your entire team here, and just pick and choose who to include 
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:bar_chart: Solution</h3>
This is the proposal part of the RFP. Contrary to what many agencies do, this is usually not a custom pitch but just a look at what you offer.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:moneybag: Price</h3>
Most RFPs want you to put forth a budget. Sometimes they include a budget and ask what they can get for it.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:raising_hand: Questions</h3>
Most RFPs have a Q+A process baked in. Write up a couple of common questions that you can ask to get the conversation going.

### More ways to save hours off the process

I think the q+a process is the most overlooked portion by consultants. This is a way to make an in with the person.



## Put it all together in proposal software

The trick to reducing the amount of time it takes to craft a great proposal is not just creating this info but having something that you can use to pick and pull pieces into one proposal quickly. So you're always sending exactly what asked for. 

That's where proposal software can help. THere's many options and some of the best ones will not only help you save time but also increase your chances of landing work.

## Improving your chances

1. Always include options 
This is something I learned from [Brennan Dunn](http://freepricingcourse.com/?ref=workshop). 

2. Always follow-up  
You can email to ask when you should follow up again and suggest the need for a deadline if they need more time.
My last RFP took them 2 months to reach a decision because it was a board of several people. Always takes longer. Plus know that RFPs are never a sure thing; regardless of their positive clues, your still being compared to someone else and they likely received the same positive notes.
Keep looking for more work while waiting. Hope you get the project! Can you pm me your website? I'd love to take a gander.  

3. Ask a simple question
Any RFP I’m interested in, I ask them one simple question. If they can answer it directly, I’ll move forward. If not, I move on. In the last year, I’ve responded to two formal RFPs. I lost both.

The truth of RFPs is they’re usually written with an agency in mind. I know, I’ve been the guy they were written for before. Shared by Workshop member Kurt Elster  

4. Consistency over tenacity
The people who do the best with RFP’s (and are actually the people who’ve made $100k+ from workshop) are the ones who have a system in place for replying to RFP’s specifically. They either hire someone to help, or have developed such a templated and refined process that they can do it themselves in a fraction of the time. This usually means they see it as a numbers game and don’t sweat it when they don’t hear back.

## Reaching out, on auto-pilot
One of the biggest ways you can save time is to have a process for replying to RFPs over email . Not even the proposal part. Instead the email part is what takes a long time.

## Reducing the amount of time it takes to find RFPs
It can be really time consuming to find RFPs. The problem is they're usually isolated. Companies post them on their website and share them with a few people they know. That can make them hard to find. Luckily there's a few websites that help. 

## They key is to make RFPs come to you
Instead of chasing them down, you want to find places where RFPs get posted to monitor. Then you can pick a few that look most relevant each week to respond to.

##  Where do you find RFPs?
The truth is they are time consuming to find. Some of the best places on the web for RFPs require constant monitoring. I know because i have a service that provides this exact service. Still, with a little elbow grease you can find some great opportunities.

## Google
Google is actually a great source for RFPs because it's so vast that you come across independent websites that have put up opportunities. The trick though is doing a smart search.

## How to search on Google
You're going to want to include `type: pdf` in your searches. This will show you PDF's that are

## How to find recent stuff on Google
Another pro-tip for you is tot change your search results to stuff created in the last week. Google doesn't do this automatically so it will save you some time not finding and getting excited about an RFP from last year.

## RFPdb.com
RFPdb is a great source of RFPs by David Kutcher. There's a feature where agencies who share RFPs get free access to the RFPs. There's often great RFPs on the site and you can search by a bunch of different categories.

## How to make sure every RFP you buy is a match on RFPdb
Every RFP has a small (censored) blurb about what to expect. Usually you can tell if an RFP is relevant by this alone but you should Read these carefully to make sure you don't waste credits on an RFP you don't care about.

Another way to get RFPs is through my lead service. This is my lead service. I basically do the leg work of finding RFPs off these other sites for you and just send you the good stuff off these other sites.  

Quality leads per week: 2-3 a week 

## How to identify a winnable RFP
Over the years I've found thousands of RFPs. However, most of them I didn't include to members of my service? I knew my members would have NO chance of winning most of them. Why? A couple reasons. To find the a quality RFP you have to look fro a few different traits. 

## Look for private over non-profit over government  
Government RFPs are the first i look to remove. They're some of the least likely leads I would apply to. There's usually a large bearucratic process involved that can even span years. There's all kinds of red tape involved. 

On the other hand. Non-profit rfps can be great. Just make sure they have an actual budget and aren't expecting a free service or donation.

Private company RFPs are the hardest to find, usually because companies like this typically only send them out to a handful of agencies. When I find these I put a premium on them.

## Look for RFPs written by humans
Another reason government RFPs suck is because they're so long. In general short RFPs are going to be better because they're not overly prescriptive. Look for RFPs you can understand quickly. This tip will serve you well throughout the project because it's an indicator that clear thought and communication is a priority for the organization you're pitching. 

> The problem with most RFPs is that they’re written by people who are as irritated that they have to write it as you are that you have to reply to it.
> That’s also the key to handling an RFP. Find out who wrote it. Most come with a contact number in case you have questions. Call it. Make friends with the people who wrote it. They may have even heard of you. If so, you’re golden. Strike up a conversation with them and get as much detail as you can about the organization involved.  
> Mike Monteiro

## They're not overly prescriptive
The other problem with RFPs is that they can be overly prescriptive in nature. They can include specific solutions that may or may not be appropriate. This is usually an indication that the organization is freaked out about having to hire designers and is trying to maintain as much control as possible—to the point where they’re going into as much detail as possible and short-circuiting the entire design process. You may be able to help them through that.

## Pro-tip pick up the phone
If an RFP starts dictating button colors, pick up the phone. It’s a cry for help and your opportunity to create mutual understanding. Speaking directly to a designer may be what they need, much more than getting 325 replies to a badly-formed RFP. Remember, not all organizations who send out formal documents have to.

## The key is to be lucky... on purpose
With RFPs there's always going to be some luck involved. However, you can also create the opportunity for luck to strike by putting yourself in the right position. Be consistent. Send 50-100 RFPs over the course of a year. Followup consistently. Suddenly, you'll find that you get a lot luckier. 

RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don’t even want to do it… they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap… just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don’t have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit’s their budget plan. As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It’s nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky! For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it’s an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I’m a big fan of guaranteed income. Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances. Shared by Workshop member Corey Tiani
