**Summary:** Reduce time wasted on laborious tasks that have almost no impact on results. This includes finding RFP's, designing proposals, and following up by hand. Instead, use your time automating proposal creation, follow-ups and making phone calls to decision-makers.

## :hand: Wait, are RFPs even worth it?

Ahh, the elusive RFP. Unless you have a lot of experience responding to them, they can seem down-right intimidating. But even the top design agencies in the world reply to them.

Of course, it's always better to get work [by referral](/referrals) BUT simply responding to 1-2 RFPs per week can mean millions of dollars in added revenue (over the course of a few years).

You can do this with *not that much extra effort*. 

That makes RFPs a great opportunity. 

And with the right approach, you can even reduce the intimidation factor substantially. This guide will show you how - and it will help you create a system that takes just 1 – 2 hours a week to manage. 

In fact, if you follow the advice in the guide, I guarantee you'll be able to reply to projects (with realistic budgets and great people at the helm) no matter how busy you are. 

So let's get started. 

### How to make RFPs suck less

RFPs suck because they're time consuming. 

Often there's not a lot of feedback involved in the process (or you don't take advantage of the feedback available) and you're left feeling like you just did a ton of work for no reason.

Failed proposals feel particularly pointless because after a few you start to wonder if you ever had a shot in the first place.

Are all of these carefully crafted proposals being sent to a black hole? Nobody got time for that.

Yet, the truth is quite a different picture. Most RFP issuers I've interviewed received less than 30 proposals total. 

That means if you do some simple math, your chances are *actually* pretty good. 

Let me explain. 

If you're **just average** at sending proposals - and respond to one a week - you're guaranteed to land a couple gigs every year. 

With the average budget size of 30-40k for an RFP, that's not a bad ROI as long as responding to one RFP a week doesn't make you hate your life.

So let's talk about how to make the process way easier.

## 1. Know what a great RFP looks like 

How to identify a winnable, RFP. Over the years I've found thousands of RFPs. However, most of them I didn't include to members of my service? I knew my members would have NO chance of winning most of them. Why? A couple reasons. To find the a quality RFP you have to look fro a few different traits. 

### Look for private over non-profit over government  
Government RFPs are the first i look to remove. They're some of the least likely leads I would apply to. There's usually a large bearucratic process involved that can even span years. There's all kinds of red tape involved. 

On the other hand. Non-profit rfps can be great. Just make sure they have an actual budget and aren't expecting a free service or donation.

Private company RFPs are the hardest to find, usually because companies like this typically only send them out to a handful of agencies. When I find these I put a premium on them.  


[Image of what a good RFP looks like vs Long one]

### Look for RFPs written by humans
Another reason government RFPs suck is because they're so long. In general short RFPs are going to be better because they're not overly prescriptive. Look for RFPs you can understand quickly. This tip will serve you well throughout the project because it's an indicator that clear thought and communication is a priority for the organization you're pitching. 

> The problem with most RFPs is that they’re written by people who are as irritated that they have to write it as you are that you have to reply to it.
> That’s also the key to handling an RFP. Find out who wrote it. Most come with a contact number in case you have questions. Call it. Make friends with the people who wrote it. They may have even heard of you. If so, you’re golden. Strike up a conversation with them and get as much detail as you can about the organization involved.  
> Mike Monteiro

### Make sure they're not overly prescriptive
The other problem with RFPs is that they can be overly prescriptive in nature. They can include specific solutions that may or may not be appropriate. This is usually an indication that the organization is freaked out about having to hire designers and is trying to maintain as much control as possible—to the point where they’re going into as much detail as possible and short-circuiting the entire design process. You may be able to help them through that.


## 2. Make creating proposals a snap by re-using stuff everyone asks for

The truth is most RFPs ask for the exact same 6-8 things. 

RFP specifications are so similar in fact, you can apply to 90% of them with almost an identical proposal.

Instead of wasting time re-making a proposal from scratch, you can create a great proposal once that you re-use again and again.

So what are the elements you should have ready to go?

</div>


<div class="rfp-elements-grid" markdown="1">
	
<div class="header" markdown="1">
	
### How to save hours on RFPs: prep these elements

Below is a list of the most most common specs you'll be asked to provide, based on analysis of [over 500 RFPs](http://app.letsworkshop.com/leads). Have these ready to go and you'll save you a ton of time.

</div>


<div class="element">
<h3>:email: Cover letter</h3>
Introduce yourself in a friendly and concise way. Add something unique to the project you're applying to.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:nail_care: Bio</h3>
Share with clients who's behind the proposal. Have a bio ready to go that tells them why you're awesome.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:telephone_receiver: Contact Info</h3>
Make it clear what the best way to contact you is. Ideally, include this info on every page (especially the last).
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:beers: Team members</h3>
Define roles for members on your team. Let the client know who else will be working on their project.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:bar_chart: Solution</h3>
What are you proposing? What's the benefit? You'll be surprised how often you can re-use "custom" solutions.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:moneybag: Price</h3>
How much is it going to cost? Include options. Sometimes you will need to stay within a  range set in the RFP.
</div>

<div class="element">
<h3>:raising_hand: Questions</h3>
Most RFPs have a Q+A process baked in. Always have a couple of questions ready to go for any  project.

## 3. Shave hours off the process by using a proposal app

Once you have these elements in place, you will still spend an outrageous amount of time designing your proposals. Surprisingly, this activity has almost no effect on the outcome.

That's why I recommend that instead you drop these common elements into proposal software and be done with it.

This will make it stupid easy to drag and drop elements to create 100% customer proposals in minutes.

There's a few options, so I've taken the time to highlight a few of my favorites.

### Here are my favorite proposal apps:

For the purposes of this guide, I'll be using Bidsketch.

**(Note: above all, it's just important that you use SOMETHING to create proposals. Don't waste time in InDesign or Keynote. It's not worth it.)**

## 4. Create a follow up sequence that sends automatically

Now that you can create proposals in a snap, it's important to make the most of then. 

You do that by communicating.

Now, yes, following up on your proposals, touching base with people you're courting, , and asking great questions can get extremely cumbersome.

For a lot of agencies this proves too much.

They forget to reply to an email, they never follow-up, and opportunities end up falling through the cracks.

<div class="reading wrap" markdown="1">

Ok I added that last part. But what the big guy was trying to say is that taking action beats sitting still. 

When it comes to RFP's, value consistency over tenacity.

That's why the firms who do the best with RFP’s are the ones who have a system in place for replying to them. 

(And I've watched first-hand as these firms made $100k+ from my RFP-finding service.)

To do this, they either hire someone like a VA who's sole job is sending out these proposals, or they develop a process that works automatically in the background. 

I'm going to walk you through how I'd set this sort of system up now. 

... but remember, you're just trying to send one proposal per week - that's it. Look at it as a numbers game and don’t sweat it when your don’t hear back. Let's get started.

### The RFP follow-up campaign

The goal of this email campaign is to open up a dialogue with the people who are running the RFP process. You're not looking to win the project with these emails - in fact - you're not even looking to stand out.

Instead you're simply looking to get a reply from the person you'll be sending a proposal to. Simply getting a response and KNOWING that a real-life breathing person is behind the computer screen is the goal.

That's why we'll be sending a simple 4-email outreach campaign.

**Ideally, this campaign will start 2 weeks before the RFP deadline:** 

<div class="rfp-email-campaign-outline">
	<div class="when">
		:speech_balloon: First email
	</div> 
	<div class="what">
		Say hello and ask a simple question.
	</div>
	
	<div class="when">
		:raising_hand: 5 days later
	</div> 
	<div class="what">
		If no response, follow up on your question.
	</div>
	
	<div class="when">
		:sleeping: 4 days later
	</div> 
	<div class="what">
		If no response, follow up again.
	</div>
	
	<div class="when">
		:scissors: 3 days later
	</div> 
	<div class="what">
		If still no response, close the loop.
	</div>
</div>

Each one of these emails will come before the proposal deadline that way you know if you should spend time crafting a proposal. 

The key is to ask an extremely simple question so that you know there's a real person reading the replies.

That's all you want. A fighting chance. 

So what should these emails say? You'll be amazed at how simple they can be.

### Writing your emails

Remember the questions we prepared earlier in this guide? You're going to pick one of them to use as a conversation starter. 

Pick the one that's easiest to answer. Ideally, clients should be able to respond to it with a simple "yes."

## Your Opening Email

<div class="rfp-email-example">
	<div class="email-number">
		<div class="step">1</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="email-message">
		<strong>Subject:</strong> great project</p>
		
		<hr style="margin: .5em 0;">

		<p>John</p>
		<p>Your RFP looks great.</p> 
		
		<p>You clearly care about the outcome of the project - so I wanted to check-in and ask <span class="insert-question-here">question</span>?</p>

		<p>Thanks</p>

		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

The key here is to ask an extremely simple question. How simple? You want even the busiest person in the world to be able to respond.

<div class="example-good-bad">
<div class="header">
<strong>Example</strong>
</div>
	
<div class="good">:thumbsup:</div> 
<div class="good-question">
&ldquo;Are you the right person to talk to about this project?&rdquo;<br>
<span><strong>Good:</strong> All I have to say is: yes!</span>
</div>

<div class="bad">:x:</div> 
<div class="bad-question">
&ldquo;Do you think my agency is a fit for your project?&rdquo;<br>
<span><strong>Bad:</strong> I'm not sure how to answer this.</span>
</div>

<div class="download">
:sparkles: For more examples of questions that are easy to respond to, <a href="/ctas">check out my cta swipe file</a>. 
</div>
</div>

Now, onto the second and third emails. 

## Your Follow-ups

<div class="rfp-email-example">
	<div class="email-number">
		<div class="step">2</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="email-message">
		<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: great project</p>
		
		<hr style="margin: .5em 0;">

		<p>Following up incase you missed my question.</p>
		
		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="rfp-email-example">
	<div class="email-number">
		<div class="step">3</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="email-message">
		<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: great project</p>
		
		<hr style="margin: .5em 0;">

		<p>I'm following up to see if you're still looking for proposals. If so, I'd love to see how we can work together. </p>
		
		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

Look, I know these emails look too simple. 

But don't be afraid, you're simply following up on an email you sent. You're not going to bug the person you're emailing, they're busy, they might not have time to get back to you at the exact moment you emailed them.

So a couple simple follow-up emails is all you need. 

## Your Loop Closer

<div class="rfp-email-example">
	<div class="email-number">
		<div class="step">4</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="email-message">
		<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: great project</p>
		
		<hr style="margin: .5em 0;">
		
		<p>Since I have not heard from you on this, I have to assume your priorities have changed.</p>
		
		<p>Robert</p>
	</div>
</div>

This email is dubbed [The Magic Email](http://themagicemail.com) because it works so well at getting a client who has ignored you to respond. 

It's considerate because you're taking the initiative to close the loop on the conversation that never started. 

This is how professionals close the loop.

## A few more ways to dramatically improve your chances...


<div class="emoji-list">
	
<div class="emoji-list-row">

<div>
:question:
</div>
  
<div markdown="1">
**Use the Q+A process**<br>
The Q+A process is one of the most underrated portions of the RFP process. Most consultants overlook it, but it's the best way to make inroads with the person you're contacting.
</div>

</div>

<div class="emoji-list-row">

<div>
:school_satchel:
</div>
 
<div markdown="1">
**Include options**<br>
Inside your proposal you should have a few different packages that clients can choose from. This is something I learned in [Brennan Dunn's free pricing course](http://freepricingcourse.com/?ref=workshop). Strongly recommended.
</div>

</div>


<div class="emoji-list-row">

<div>
:phone:
</div>
 
<div markdown="1">
**Call them**<br>
One of the best ways to stand out is to give prospects a ring. One of the benefits of RFPs is that they almost always include a phone number. A simple 5-minute phone call introducing yourself can be enough to separate you from the pack. Pro-tip pick up the phone 

If an RFP starts dictating button colors, pick up the phone. It’s a cry for help and your opportunity to create mutual understanding. Speaking directly to a designer may be what they need, much more than getting 325 replies to a badly-formed RFP. Remember, not all organizations who send out formal documents have to.
</div>

</div>

</div>

## Create your own luck... on purpose
With RFPs there's always going to be some luck involved. However, you can also create the opportunity for luck to strike by putting yourself in the right position. Be consistent. Send 50-100 RFPs over the course of a year. Followup consistently. Suddenly, you'll find that you get a lot luckier.

# Now that you're an RFP master... where the heck do you find RFPs?

So far we've covered how to make it dead simple to reply to RFPs and give yourself the best possible chance at finding them. 

The last part of this guide will be dedicated to finding them and reducing the amount of time this takes.

Why? Because it can actually be really time consuming to find RFPs. The problem is they're usually spread around the web. 

Companies post them on their website and share them with a few people they know. That can make them difficult to find. 

## They key is to make RFPs come to you...

Luckily there's a few websites that help. Below I've compiled the best sources for RFPs I've found over years of testing. 

Instead of chasing down RFPs across thousands of websites, you can monitor a few sites. Let's start with my service though. Here's some recent RFPs I've found and sent to members of this website:

All of these RFPs are high-quality projects I found myself in the last few days. I send them to paying members of my service [Workshop](/). 

###  Prefer to find RFPs yourself? Here's where and how...

<img src="/images/google-logo.svg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

Google is actually a great source for RFPs because what you want is to search across thousands of independent websites.

The trick is you want to type <span class="include-this">type:pdf</span> in your search. That way you get PDFs of the RFPs you're looking for, like so:

<img src="/images/google-type-pdf-tutorial.gif" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 5px;">

Next you're going to want to change your search results to show you stuff created in the last week. Google doesn't do this automatically so it will save you some time not finding and getting excited about an RFP from last year.

Overall as a source of leads Google ranks pretty high among the services I've tried.

# RFPdb.com

Another great source of RFPs is RFPdb. The site is credit-based so you pay for a minimum of 10 credits and you can access RFPs (2 credits each). 

You can also share RFPs on the site to get access to more credits. Every RFP has a free (censored) blurb about the project. 


<img src="/images/rfpdb.png" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 5px;">

Usually, you can gain enough from this blurb to tell whether it's relevant to you or not. That way you don't waste credits on an RFP you don't care about.

Another way to get RFPs is through my lead service. This is my lead service. I basically do the leg work of finding RFPs off these other sites for you and just send you the good stuff off these other sites.  

Quality leads per week: 2-3 a week 


> RFPs are an interesting animal. From my experience, most of the marketing folks involved with sending an RFP out for bid don’t even want to do it… they have to. I have a rather pleasant ongoing contract with a large state organization in PA, and they were smart enough to use their 1-year extension option with my contract to avoid having to send this out for bid yearly. Every other year, however, they are required by the state auditor general to do this RFP crap… just like every other state funded organization in PA. They don’t have to choose by price, and in the end they get to make the final call so long as it fit’s their budget plan. As Kurt Elster said, the RFPs are written with someone particular in mind for the job (me). It’s nice to be on the inside of that situation, but they are difficult to respond to for folks on the outside looking in. Sometimes you just get lucky! For me, when it comes to RFPs, I always weigh the value of the project against the time and hassle involved. If it’s an ongoing contract, I usually give it a little more consideration. I’m a big fan of guaranteed income. Moral of the story is that hatred for the RFP is mutual in a lot of instances. Shared by Workshop member Corey Tiani
