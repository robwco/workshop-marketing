You wouldn't want to live in a house that had a ceiling your height. So why run your business that way?

Build a buffer. Account for that you know are going to happen like, down-time, research, administration, bad clients and more.

Even when you think you don't need to find work, you should be reaching out to new people. 

Add 50% to your estimate. Then bring it back if you need to, but start with a little extra.

Freelance communities are full of people struggling to find work. They ask questions like:

- "Where do people find good clients?"
- "What is the best job board?"

These are the wrong questions.

When you tell the love of your life you love them it's real. When you tell your parents thank you for everything they've done, it's real. 

You don't pull those words from some blog post, they come from you. So be real. Real is better.

Why? Because you can tell when someone is speaking from the heart. You can tell when someone doesn't fully believe what they're saying. So avoid the script. Speak from the heart.

Reading is work. It's your job to take work away from your clients. 

So write better. 

It will not only make you more money, it will make your clients more money. 

They'll read more of what you write. They'll respond and take action on more it.

And you'll save them time.

People don't want to hire someone because they love to give money away. They want something to happen. They want a result.

**So sell that.**

Look for places you're not addressing the result a client wants and fit it. 

Add more context. How does that screenshot of your last project highlight what this client wants? 

If you don't include that, what's the point? Is there even a reason you're showing them?

They're coming to you for expertise don't expect them to connect the dots by themselves.

Every person's favorite topic is themselves. So why talk about ourselves in our emails?

If you had to replace the words "I", "me", and "my" in your emails and make the client the focus what would you say?

> I've helped hundreds of businesses build their website's interfaces.

Might become:

> Your website looks like it could use a new website interface.

"Here are some random thoughts..." are possibly the worst five words you can use in an email.

Nobody wants random thoughts.
