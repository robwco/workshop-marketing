To a client you aren't a chief UX research officer, you're the guy that decides what to put on their website. 

Don't hide it, celebrate it! That guy's better anyway.

Overcomplicated job titles get misunderstood.

Nobody really "builds digital experiences," and even less actually want to buy that.

So don't sell it.

Instead, sell websites that make money. Or interfaces that retain customers. 

Tie your job to what a business wants, not what your ego thinks it wants.
