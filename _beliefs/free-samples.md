Most businesses know that giving away something for free gets customers in the door and coming back. 

But for some reason freelancers miss this. 

They hide their expertise by making you pay thousands of dollars before they help you.

Why?

Why not give a sample of yourself away for free. It's better than making claims, it's proof. 

You don't have to do free work, just package your expertise in a way that makes sense to you. 

Some easy examples are:

- A blog post
- An email course
- A free plugin

All of these are low-cost and help you build a relationship with potential clients.

Provide something that will make a problem go away and they'll come back for more.
