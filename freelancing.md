## Why do dry spells happen to good freelancers?

When you're in a dry spell an untimely bill can put your checking account in the red at any moment. This cycle regularly pokes holes in your income, business trajectory, and sanity. Yet most freelancers don't know the true cause.

## It's not why you think. Dry spells are NOT a natural part of freelancing. 
Every sales cycle will naturally go through ebbs and flows - BUT long periods without work don't occur just because. They actually happen because of inaction.

Think back to the last time you didn't have any work. While this time probably sucked, it also probably kicked your butt into high gear. 

In fact, that's probably the last time you dedicated whole days just to looking for work.

When you're a freelancer, it seems like work is destined to come in bunches and leave you thinking: "Where were all of these clients 2 weeks ago?"

The truth is you have a hand in it – and if you stopped waiting until you're out of work to jumpstart your client outreach, you could totally avoid it.

## Dry spells actually begin when you're fully-booked!
See, just like you suck at estimating how long a client project will take, you also suck at estimating how long the income you just got will sustain you.

The truth is if you don’t keep looking for opportunities when you have work, dry spells are closer than you think.

The trick is not waiting until you're out of work to do something about them.

Alternatively, if you keep contacting new opportunities when you're booked solid - you'll be able to negotiate and say no to new projects that aren't a fit from a position of power. 

That's hard to do when you are starving for work. 

## That’s why you should keep emailing leads even when you HAVE work.
It sounds simple but you probably don't it because finding new clients takes a lot of effort. 

And just thinking you can force yourself to keep up isn't the answer either. When you have work, by definition, you're more busy. 

That's when your ability and desire to look for work is weak. So understandably, you ignore it.  

But what if you had a system for finding high quality new opportunities that you could do no matter how busy you are?

Something that didn't add any more work to your plate. Something that kept running even when you were on vacation.

I wished something like this existed when I freelanced so I created it. I created [Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com) a lead generation service for freelance designers and developers that sends the best freelance opportunities everyday.

## Free trial: You can get 8-12 high-quality freelance leads emailed to you right now. 
I also created this free trial offer because I know freelancers are skeptical of services like this (and rightfully so).

I too run my business frugally and need every investment to pull its weight. That's why you can now get a free sample of my service absolutely free.

There’s no strings attached and nothing between you and the clients I'll send. You can email them directly from your inbox and start working with them today.

Why am I doing this? It's something I wish I had when I was freelancing. I wanted to build a stable, profitable business but doing sales was daunting. It would take me hours to find just one qualified lead. It's not worth your time.

*Disclaimer:* All I ask in return for this trial is that if you find work from one of the free leads I send you, you let me know so I can ask you a few questions about how you did it. 

Again it's absolutely free, and each lead you'll receive has been hand-checked to make sure it's from someone 1) looking for a freelancer, not an employee 2) open to working remotely with a freelancer anywhere and 3) have a budget of at least $1000.

After I send the leads I'll also show you how I find hundreds of high-quality leads using 100% free tools. So you can do it yourself in minutes instead of hours. 

It's a system I've built that will walk you through how to go from paycheck-to-paycheck freelancing to booked 6-12 months in advanced. 

I don't know how long I'll offer the free trial (probably until I sell out of Workshop subscriptions) so don't wait.
