<h1 class="leading-tight font-medium text-3xl">Using Feedbin's powerful automation magic to do the lead-sifting for you</h1>

In the last lesson we introduced you to Feedbin. I'm a bit of a Feedbin fanboy at this point and I'm about to share why.

Feedbin has some amazing features that can take care of a lot of the work in finding high-value clients.

**Like the starred article feed:**

The starred article feed (you can find it under settings) let's you setup lead-sifting that talks to other apps. 

For example, you can star any jobs you're interested in and have this feed go create a to-do in Basecamp.

That's handy so you don't forget to followup. 

It's also helpful if you're working with a team because you can assign tasks to this like finding email addresses, adding prospects to outreach sequences, and more.

But wait, does that mean you have to add projects to this starred feed by hand?

Nope. The magic sauce gets even better. 

<img src="/images/page-elements/feedbin-actions.png" class="shadow-lg w-full rounded-lg mb-4">

You can create actions in Feedbin (under settings > actions) that star projects automatically. 

The control here is limitless:

- You can star any post that contains a keyword. 
- You can star a post from a specific website.
- You can even add rules for groups of websites.
- You can mix and match filters together.

This lets you bake in human discernment to what projects get starred. For example, you can tell Feedbin to  star jobs from Dribbble when they use the word "anywhere".

<img src="/images/page-elements/feedbin-dribbble-star-it.png" class="shadow-lg w-full rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">

Because Dribbble uses the word "anywhere" to specify a remote project and others don't, this lets you account for that with dribbble-specific rules.

That's amazing. It lets you outsource lead-by-lead decision-making without losing quality or sorting through thousands yourself. This way you'll know every job that gets put into your star feed is perfect for you - and you don't have to lift a finger. 

As a busy frontend design firm owner who charges a lot of money for your time, this means thousands of dollars.

Hopefully this illustrates how awesome rules in Feedbin can be. 

**Here are some of the rules I have setup:**

<img src="/images/page-elements/feedbin-rules.png" class="shadow-lg w-full rounded-lg mt-4 mb-4">

Try to create a few rules yourself that will star projects you're interested in. Remember, focus on finding projects that need a problem solved. 

Sidenote: You can even use [FetchRSS](http://fetchrss.com) to add feeds of sites you never considered. I use it for sites like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. That way as many opportunities as is possible come through this one place.

Soon you’ll have a constant flow of prospects coming through your starred feed every day. 

As I briefly mentioned above, you can even use this custom feed (in combination with a tool like Zapier) to send you an email, add a Basecamp to-do, or talk to pretty much any other app.

This system makes sure you don't burnout. It works while you sleep and continues to pay dividends long after you've set it up.

Next, Let's walk through a few examples of how to keep track of all these (and more) opportunities.
