... I couldn't find the page you were looking for, but how about I let you in on a secret:

# Feast or famine isn't just a part of freelancing you have to live with.
Sure, you might be in and out of dry spells because you don’t have time to find new work but you can end the cycle. 

There’s a better way. You can fill up your pipeline months in advanced and never worry about where your next project will come from again.

I'll help by sending you 7 lessons I've learned about finding clients – that you can implement today. 

{% include course-form.html %}

You'll also get a free email course on getting more leads and my weekly newsletter. All value, no spam.
